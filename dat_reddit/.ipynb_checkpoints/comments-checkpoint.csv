PotRoastPotato,"&gt;Joe Lockhart, the former NFL vice president of communications from 2016-18, discussed how Kaepernick's silent protests shook team owners and started a social justice conversation around the league. However, **Lockhart also admitted what no one at the NFL has ever explicitly stated about the situation**:

&gt;""No teams wanted to sign a player—even one as talented as Kaepernick—whom they saw as controversial, and, therefore, bad for business.""",2020-05-31 04:03:44

MaekerBaefield,"Eric Reid was a big part of the protest and he consistently had a job and was signed before Tre Boston and Kenny Vacarro were. The more I think about that and Kaep being benched for Blaine Gabbert, the more I think Kaep wasn’t really a starting QB in the league. People throw out his 16 TD 4 INT year but totally ignore that he got benched for a laughing stock QB and was unable to win another job. The NFL also employs women beaters, kid beaters, murderers, rapists.

Trappedintheshower,"The NFL and the teams are just a business when it’s boiled down. Dumb people don’t own sports teams, and if they do they have smart people helping them run it. 

Even if the owner is in support of the cause he was trying to promote, they know their fan base most likely isn’t. Look at the general demographic of what you would call stereotypical diehard NFL fans. It’s obvious they mostly likely don’t support what Kaep was promoting. 

Business is about making money, and when you’re talking about millions upon millions of dollars of possibly lost revenue generally the greed of the rich team owners will outweigh their support of Kaep’s cause. 

Would an NBA time sign a player who made comments supporting the cop that killed George Floyd? No chance.

People want this to be a race issue so desperately, but its just not. The NFL will sign anyone no matter how ""bad for business"" they might be if they can play. We're talking about the league that has dozens of domestic abusers on rosters. A league that signed Mike Vick after he literally went to prison for his brutal dog fighting operation. A league that had multiple teams sign Donte Stallworth after he literally killed someone driving drunk.

JessumB,"&gt;saying it wasn't because of his talent

Of course it was because of the talent ultimately.   He was seen as too much of a potential distraction compared to what he offered as a player.  

  If he was as good as Russell Wilson or Aaron Rodgers, teams would let him kneel on the 50 yard line to start and finish each half while being escorted by the Black Panthers and would give zero fucks as to what anyone thought.  True franchise QB's are absolutely priceless.   


How much teams are willing to put up with depends almost entirely on just how good you are.   You can be a huge asshole but as long as you are really good, you have a job.

That's just how it is for QBs. You get credit for the wins regardless of whether it's deserved, and you get blame for the losses regardless of whether it's deserved.

Kaep is often described as a QB who ""led a team to the SB,"" even though he's far less deserving of that credit than Frank Gore or Patrick Willis or Justin Smith or Navarro Bowman or Joe Staley. But he was the QB and they weren't, so suddenly it's ""his team"" that ""he took"" to the SB.

Happens all the time. Tom Brady was mediocre in his 1st SB win. Peyton Manning was underwhelming in both of his SB wins. But they got the credit, because they were QBs and Lawyer Milloy and Von Miller weren't.

Flip side of that is the QB gets the blame when the team loses. If Peyton's team loses because the kicker misses a chip shot, Peyton gets the blame. Jimmy G took blame for the SB loss, as if he was the one out there giving up 3rd &amp; 15 conversions.",2020-05-31 07:34:44

&gt;[Colin Kaepernick's first workout with an NFL team since he became a free agent more than a year ago was nixed by the Seattle Seahawks after the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback refused to say whether he planned to continue to kneel during the national anthem, a person with knowledge of the discussions told USA TODAY Sports.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2018/04/12/colin-kaepernick-seattle-seahawks-protest-national-anthem/511389002/) 

&gt;The Seahawks were slated to work out Kaepernick on Monday, a meeting that was scheduled about two weeks prior without any mention of kneeling, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. Seattle then inquired late last week about his plans on further protests.

&gt;Kaepernick's response: He was focused on football and wasn't going to agree to preconditions. 

&gt;A short time later, the Seahawks called off the workout. ",2020-05-31 11:02:41
powerlesshero111,"That's the thing though, he's not a back up QB. Harbaugh knew how to use his strengths, and he did great, took the 49ers to a superbowl. The new coach didn't play to his strengths, and the rift caused him to switch to Gabbert (who is no longer the 49ers starting QB). A good coach doesn't build plays around what he wants to do, he builds them around what his players are good at. 

If you compare Tebow and Kap, who both want to be starting QBs, Tebow is wayyyy worse. Like he can't throw. He has great legs and can hold the ball, and when the Pats picked up Tebow, they wanted him as a fullback, where he probably would have lead the league in touchdowns, but he refused, and wanted to be a QB. Kap, with the right coach, would probably still be a consistent play off QB. Honestly, with his arm, I'm shocked the Pats haven't tried to pick him up now that Brady is gone. 

Honestly, controversy can sell. It just depends on the type. A kneeling protest, that can sell, because you'll get people like Mike Pence buying tickets to just walk out if they kneel, but they bought tickets (yes, i know Mike Pence didn't buy the tickets, but people like him will). Illegal stuff, like beating a girlfriend or murder (ala Aaron Hernandez), that makes it hard to sell tickets.",2020-05-31 11:03:42
smokecheck1976,"That isn't complete.  Kapernick was nowhere near good enough on the upside to be worth the headache on the downside.  To be blunt, a more fair assessment is that Kapernick was not good enough to be a third option or even a practice team quarterback.  He struggled at pre-snap defense reads, he could not read a defense post snap, he rarely looked anywhere other than his first receiver, if his first receiver was covered Kapernick did not step through his options, he pulled the ball down and ran with it.  While he came off the bench for about 6 games one season, once NFL defensive coordinators had an offseason to look at what he was doing, his gig was up.

Since much of Reddit will flatly refuse to believe me, here is all that really needs to be said, these are Kapernick's stats from his last game against a sub-par NFL defense:

 Week 13  12/04/2016  at Chicago Bears  L   6 - 26 1 Completion 5 Attempts 4 total passing yards 0.8 yards per attempt 0 TD 0 INT 5 Sacks 25 Sack Yards 39.6 Passer Rating 6 Rushing Attempts 20 Total Yards 3.3 Yards per attempt 0 TD 1 Fumble 0 Fumbles lost

RibeyeRare,"The fact is, viewership and fan loyalty probably wouldn’t be affected much either way.

Additionally, the teams share profits so even if they did lose some ticket and concession sales, they’d still make tons of money from merchandising and other revenues.

What it _is_ about is the ideal. It’s clear that the owners do not want to allow the nfl to be politicized in that way, either due to the message, or because they do not wish the NFL to be a forum for political expression. That is legitimate, and legal, even though I don’t agree with the owners. Many businesses have regulations they impose on employees for how they conduct themselves on the job and even in public (when not working). This ranges from dress codes and personal grooming standards to activity on social media and public speaking. In many states, where employment is “at will,” you can be fired for any reason (so long as it’s not illegal, like age, sex, race, religion). No employer is obliged to hire anyone, regardless of what they can bring to the table in terms of profitability, experience  or skill set.

Silvea,"This isn’t even an argument about whether he was wrong to take that stance. I completely agree with what is being said here. I for one agree with his cause, but the way he chose to promote it caused a lot of issues. 

It’s a pretty obvious problem what is going on when it comes to black men and the police. I applaud that he chose to make a stand for it, it’s a great cause. He picked something he knew would be insanely controversial because that would get his message out. The problem with that is the backlash from what a lot of Americans saw as “disrespecting the flag, the nation, and the soldiers who have fought and died for that flag”. 

Now some people didn’t care, a lot of people did care. Had he done something like wore an arm band of a certain color and brought attention to that’s why he was wearing it and that anyone who wanted to join in solidarity for this cause should wear the same, I think his message would have been welcomed with a warm response. Instead he chose something that in itself caused a lot of controversy and that detracted away from his message. 

It’s no secret that people were upset with him kneeling. I’ve seen people who go to games in wheel chairs that with assistance stand for the anthem. The NFL got a lot of backlash not because of the message but how he got it out there. He painted himself a pariah. Any team that took him on knew that any fans that were angered by his form of protest, would look unfavorably at them. 

TLDR: It’s obvious that with the amount of controversy his protest brought that no team was willing to bring it to their stadium. Any team that signed him would be seen as endorsing his kneeling. That would be bad for business and that’s what they are there for... if he had chosen another way to protest that people didn’t see as disrespectful it would have likely gone over much better.

Kahzootoh,"The woke crowd isn’t buying season tickets. People who don’t like football are unlikely to develop a liking for it based off of one man’s political activism; if that was the case, we’d have football players appealing to every untapped demographic (women, Hispanics, gays, etc) if only to work the system for maximum profits. 

I think you are underestimating just how much the predominantly white, older, male, and Republican leaning core of the NFL fanbase hates Democrats. Bringing on Kaepernick alone would have been enough for people to burn their jerseys, not buy tickets, and turn the team into a stand in for Nancy Pelosi among a largely republican leaning fanbase. 

Remember when people burned Nike’s over Kaepernick? Nike’s are reasonably good shoes and some are reasonably priced, people are a lot less likely to buy season tickets if they don’t live in a particular city and even then they aren’t cheap. 

This idea that the fans won’t hate him because he doesn’t get much playtime is something that I disagree with: they’d constantly point out how “he doesn’t even play” and the team brought him on as a political stunt. If he does play, every flaw or shortcoming would be under a microscope. Unless he was the best quarterback in the league and winning every game, he’d be getting hate. 

A serious amount of NFL money comes from TV deals, and this is the serious damage would be done. People who hate Democrats aren’t going to pay to watch Kaepernick’s team when they could easily watch anything else with the press of a button. If Kaep gets injured, they can just hear about it on Fox News later without having to waste time watching him play. 

It’s definitely possible to be an unimpressive player while remaining an attractive asset to a team’s brand. Tim Tebow is one of the best examples of that. He wasn’t particularly good, but fans loved his squeaky clean Christian image and his skin of the teeth wins. Unlike Tebow, Kaepernick was hated by many fans as he came to personify Democratic racial politics and winning the approval of the woke crowd wouldn’t replace the loss in profits.",2020-05-31 12:57:08

TaxAllHairDye,"I remember seeing 2017 training camp ""rankings"" on the NFL Network where they had him in the low 20's to low 30's.  What that translates to is he would likely have to play in one of these scenarios:

* QB competition to start on a bad team
* Backup on a team where his play style fits (eg Ravens or Titans) 

Now the question to a team is: 

* How many net wins would Kaepernick yield vs another QB? 
* Do those extra wins mean a playoff spot? 
* Is the media circus worth it? 

I ask these questions because what is the point of signing Kaepernick, if he leads your team to 5 wins instead of 3 wins with a different QB.  The team gets a worse draft pick and a media circus. 

If a team signs him as a backup, he might never play and you get a media circus.  If he does play, your season might be sunk anyway as that means your top tier QB is hurt. 

Here's the thing, if Colin was a borderline starter as a Cornerback, I guarantee he would be signed. A borderline starter is guaranteed to play and have an impact. Additionally, there is a massive talent drop off at the position so someone who is 3rd or 4th best on a team is often many times more competent than the 5th or 6th best.",2020-05-31 12:58:32

CO_74,"This isn’t entirely true. There was a team that offered Kaepernick a contract the very next season and no one ever mentions it. 

The Denver Broncos offered Kap a contract worth (iirc) about $11 million a year just after he was cut. Kap thought he was worth $18 million a year. The Broncos were looking to sign Kap rather than pay Brock Osweiler. Kap decided to hold out for a better offer that never came. Keep in mind, even this short few years ago, QB salaries were very different. There was a “middle class” when it came to QB talent (there isn’t one now). Most Broncos fans like myself viewed Osweiller as a better option than Kaepernick at the time. 

Some say that the Broncos lowballed Kap, but the Broncos also lowballed Osweiller, apparently. Remember that Osweiller was coming off of a Super Bowl 50 season in which he had successfully backed up (and had outplayed) Peyton Manning.  Osweiller started about 4 games that year, I believe. The Broncos offered Osweiller $16 million, but he left and took $18 million from the Texans.",2020-05-31 13:30:56

He turned it down because he though he was worth more than $11 million. Brock Osweiller also turned the Broncos same contract offer down so they ended up having to go with Trevor Siemien the year after their Super Bowl victory. 

Keep in mind that Kaep wanted $20 million, which would have made him the fifth highest paid QB in the league at that time. The Broncos offer of $11 million would have made him about the 20th highest paid - which would have been about right. Kaep just though he was worth more.

There's a lot of criticism you can say about Kaepernick's game, but this isn't one of them. Good teams and good coaches try to build their team around their leaders in a way that would help them succeed. For example, Lamar Jackson isn't your traditional ""pro style"" quarterback, but the Ravens got incredible success from him this past year by building a team around his style of play. Nick Foles had one of the most iconic Super Bowl runs of all time by allowing him to constantly run the RPO. Every Seahawks fan knows that they try to run a ""pro style"" offense until the 4th quarter when they're losing and need Russell Wilson to bail them out.

If gladiatorial death matches were legal and making 25 billion dollars, high school and middle schools would have gladiator training programs.

rma843,"Doesn’t seem like a lot of people on here actually follow football. While I’m sure people are set in their ways on this, I’ll inform anyone who is open minded.

First off, multiple teams sent offers including Broncos, Seahawks and ravens; who all had “trouble” players that do way worse than get political. The problem is Kaepernick peaked and was losing his throwing ability, likely due to injuries such as the torn ligaments in his throwing hand. John Elway is one of three coaches who made an offer but said it didn’t seem like he was actually trying to be on the team. Kaepernick was asking for “peak Colin Kaepernick” money when In reality he showed consecutive years in the bottom percentage of pass completion. For example, in 2016 Eli Manning was making $17.5 million but took a $7 million pay cut cause he knew he wasn’t super bowl Eli anymore. 

Now I’ll put on my tinfoil hat and state my opinion if anyone is still reading or interested. I think Colin truly cared about the movement and did great things with it. However, I believe when his contract ended with SF and no teams were interested in picking him up (due to his poor numbers and age ) he realized this and saw an opportunity to be an activist when Nike reaches out to him, estimated to be around $5 million a year (all the money, none of the concussions!).

Close.  It would be illegal if any two or more teams were talking to each other and agreed to act collectively and deny a player access to a free market.

The timeline of those two apparent conflicting points you made were not concurrent, but end-joined. Your second point also needs adjusting unless you think *two* teams equals “a bunch”.

Then the Dolphins showed interest and Kaepernick ruined that himself with a Tweet supporting Fidel Castro which made him public enemy #1 with the Miami fan base.

And *that’s* when bench riding Kaepernick shoveled on the coal with his social justice efforts which evidently made any remaining interested franchises abandon any thought of acquiring a diminished gimmick QB with presently lousy stats and a media circus in tow under the condition he wouldn’t be a starter despite Kaepernick steadfastly refusing a backup position.",2020-05-31 16:54:40

The NFL contacts teams, says there will be an in-season workout for one player on a Saturday 5 days away. On Wednesday they sent Kaep the paperwork. Multiple media members have said that these things take time to read and the original copy had legitimate problems that could be used in court to argue that he waived his right to sue the League in the future for any reason. So Kaep sent back a different waiver, the NFL refused to sign it, and there we go. Much more mundane, huh? Not to mention Kaep requested the workout be open to media and have his own film crew present, which the NFL refused.

If the NFL planned this for longer and Kaep backed out late, then I can understand, as there would have been enough time for Kaep to raise these concerns early and get them worked out or bail early.

internet_poster,"&gt; But mostly because it makes mobile QBs who run well like Kaepernick look WORSE than they are.

Not necessarily.  Kaepernick fumbled 9 times in 2016 and got sacked another 36 times.  None of this shows up in passer rating.  In aggregate Kaepernick's passer rating from 2016 is pretty decent because he had very few interceptions, but was terrible at moving the ball.

It's also not like QBR is an outlier here.  ANY/A is also a much more sensible weighting for QB stats than passer rating and it suggests that Kaepernick was even worse in his final two seasons (33rd and 23rd, respectively) and even better in his first two seasons (2nd in 2012 and 8th in 2013).

It's very clear that Kaepernick was a much less effective quarterback in 2016 than he was early in his career.  

&gt; All you need to know QBR is suspect is that a huge part of its calculation is a ""clutch"" factor. ""Clutch"" is a thoroughly debunked concept in sports by legitimate statisticians.

This is false.  [""Unlike the initial version of QBR released in 2011, plays are no longer up-weighted for “clutch situations,""](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/123701/how-is-total-qbr-calculated-we-explain-our-quarterback-rating)

&gt; Even with the highly suspect QBR stat your conclusion is that he's at the bottom end of starters... And bottom end starters make millions of dollars per year as bad starters or good backups.

Kaepernick was certainly better than players like Blake Bortles, Case Keenum, and Brock Osweiler, 2 of whom remain on NFL rosters to this day.  But there's also this weird strain of Kaepernick trutherism that insists he was a totally solid NFL starter or even (in your case) he was playing at the same level as he was early in his career.

Good thing I never made that argument. The most I've said is that QB rating implies he was  just about an average  NFL starter, and his QB rating didn't take a sharp decline. 

That said his Super Bowl year he was way above average so I've never said he didn't decline in production, but he was also surrounded by the worst team in the league. I've also stipulated several times here that even if QBR or other less generous stats are the totally magically correct Word of God QB rating, Kaepernick still belongs on an NFL roster as a low-end starter or high-end backup.",2020-05-31 20:33:25

He had a couple of opportunities - but not as many as he should have had for a player of his caliber. 

There were at least two other players that were blackballed far worse than Kaep for there statements. Chris Kluwe of the Vikings (pro gay marriage statements) and Mahmoud Abdul Raouf of the Nuggets (Islamic opposition to the national anthem).  Both were in their primes and handed their walking papers never to play again. 

It goes to show, if you’re white, black, Christian, Islamic - doesn’t matter. If you’re a pro athlete making public statements about politics, sex, or race - you are probably going to get shown the door. It’s not right and it’s not fair. But it happens.",2020-05-31 21:53:11

My belief is that it's the same as it ever was back to the inception of policemen themselves. It's just that citizens have mobile video recording and social media to post that video on broadly, so now there's visibility. In other words, the system has always been flawed, but now we finally have the tools to share just how badly those flaws hurt people.

I won’t pretend to be smart enough to come up with the best solution but I think it would be a start to implement measures that hold police accountable, including:

- Truly independent internal investigations; no more investigating themselves

- Culture change in police training. From what I’ve read police are trained with the mindset that they’re going to war; “us vs them” instead of on the same side as the community they protect. Deescalation training and maybe make the process to become a cop take longer than 6 months.

- malpractice insurance like medical practitioners carry, paid for personally. When a cop is sued their insurance pays any settlements (instead of taxpayer dollars like now), and the cops insurance premiums go up, pricing them out of police work after multiple lawsuits. They need to be personally accountable rather than just having the taxpayer foot the bill.",2020-05-31 23:31:10

Kaep put up better numbers than Tim on his worst team which was a  terrible 49ers team that had already fallen apart.

""Just because the statistics show that more black people are convicted for crimes, does not mean black people are more likely to commit crimes.""

Yes, that's why you use the murder rate as the best indicator of violent crime as it is more or less universally reported. One racial cohort commits more murder than ALL of the rest of society.
