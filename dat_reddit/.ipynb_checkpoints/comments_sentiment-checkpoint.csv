"So you mean all the idiots trying to convince us it was about football were full of shit?

Color me shocked. Well way to go, guys. Ignoring peaceful protests and even ridiculing it like Kaepernick got us here",aloneinorbit-,0.255,0.557,0.188,-0.5423
"&gt;Joe Lockhart, the former NFL vice president of communications from 2016-18, discussed how Kaepernick's silent protests shook team owners and started a social justice conversation around the league. However, **Lockhart also admitted what no one at the NFL has ever explicitly stated about the situation**:

&gt;""No teams wanted to sign a player—even one as talented as Kaepernick—whom they saw as controversial, and, therefore, bad for business.""",PotRoastPotato,0.14,0.754,0.105,-0.1779

"NFL teams don't want controversy out of their back up QBs. Kap was without a doubt good enough to have still been in the league, but he wasn't good enough that teams couldn't pass on him.",Gaitingdoochain,0.106,0.806,0.088,-0.1815
The truth is he wasn't good enough to outweigh the drama. It's as simple as that,ndunks1,0.129,0.748,0.123,-0.0274
"Eric Reid was a big part of the protest and he consistently had a job and was signed before Tre Boston and Kenny Vacarro were. The more I think about that and Kaep being benched for Blaine Gabbert, the more I think Kaep wasn’t really a starting QB in the league. People throw out his 16 TD 4 INT year but totally ignore that he got benched for a laughing stock QB and was unable to win another job. The NFL also employs women beaters, kid beaters, murderers, rapists. 

Idk, as much as one would like to say he was black balled I’m not so sure anymore.",MaekerBaefield,0.165,0.739,0.096,-0.8462

No shit. That and he wasn't that good.  Even Antonio Brown played a couple games last year on skill alone,thebasisofabassist,0.171,0.622,0.207,0.2306
"Well, blackballing him was also bad for business; I haven't watched an NFL game since. No swag, no eyeballs, no ratings, no shirt, nothing.",ttystikk,0.181,0.572,0.247,0.0165
"Man, you have a quote from an a recent NFL VP saying it wasn't because of his talent but the controversy he brought, yet you still doubt. 

I'm a huge NFL fan and I'm racking my brain trying to think who Eric Reid is and who he plays/played for.

Meanwhile every man, woman in child in America knows Kaepernick and has an opinion on him. Not the case for Reid. 

The idea that Kaepernick wasn't good enough to be a backup or even third string QB somewhere by talent is pretty damn preposterous. Anyone who makes that argument basically is revealing that they don't know what they're talking  about when it comes to football.

Don't take my word for it, you now have the word from the horse's mouth, a former NFL executive.",PotRoastPotato,0.086,0.811,0.103,0.3901
