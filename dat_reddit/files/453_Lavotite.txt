The pats have zero cap space. The most expensive qb they can afford is hoyer and he’s worth because he knows their system. 

Tebow had the problem where he didn’t want to be anything besides a qb and he wasn’t good enough to deal with the problems he created as a backup.  

The two things that probably killed kap was the salary he wanted(because as you said he wanted to start) and that you had to build a team around his strengths. It makes sense no one wants to be a backup, when if it works out he’d get the short side of the stick 

He burned the bridge for the team he had the best chance with though. For no reason.
