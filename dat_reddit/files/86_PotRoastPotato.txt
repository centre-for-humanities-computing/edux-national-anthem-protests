Umm... No, not lying about either. I've played fantasy football for more than 25 straight seasons (not proud of that). I subscribe to NFL Sunday Ticket every year. I still curse Neil O'Donnell and Larry Brown for conspiring to hand the Lombardi to Barry Switzer in the 90s. I'm still pissed off Myles Jack was called down on that fumble recovery against the Pats in the AFCCG a couple years ago, it  robbed the Jags in  the only year they've been good since David Garrard and Jack Del Rio.

And I have no fucking clue who Chris Reid is.
