What are you talking about?  i didn't say any form of protest is wrong.  Try working at any place and protest while at work, no one will allow to.  Go work at Chiptole and hand out BLM or MAGA shirts at the check out counter and tell me you won't get fired.

The inability to think reasonably is why there's an issue in the first place.  Kaep is already famous.  He can launch any compaign he wants using his celebrity status.  He can get supporters. Yet he chose to run his campaign at work.
