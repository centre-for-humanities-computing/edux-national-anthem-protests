I have given and received blindside hits for both sports. Hands down it is worse in football, even more so if it’s a full tackle and not just a hit. It usually comes down to the whiplash factor. I got whiplash much more in football than hockey. Also, most hits in hockey are along the boards. This sounds worse, but they provide a lot of give and limit the force you’d have when hitting the ground or ice. 

Let’s put it this way, despite being a big guy (5’11” - 215 lbs. during my playing days) I sustained far worse injuries in hockey from blocking shots than from hits.
