&gt;saying it wasn't because of his talent

Of course it was because of the talent ultimately.   He was seen as too much of a potential distraction compared to what he offered as a player.  

  If he was as good as Russell Wilson or Aaron Rodgers, teams would let him kneel on the 50 yard line to start and finish each half while being escorted by the Black Panthers and would give zero fucks as to what anyone thought.  True franchise QB's are absolutely priceless.   


How much teams are willing to put up with depends almost entirely on just how good you are.   You can be a huge asshole but as long as you are really good, you have a job.   You can be extremely controversial, but as long as you are really good, you have a job.   You can be considered a distraction but as long as you are really good, you have a job.
