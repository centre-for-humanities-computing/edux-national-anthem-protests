Doesn’t seem like a lot of people on here actually follow football. While I’m sure people are set in their ways on this, I’ll inform anyone who is open minded.

First off, multiple teams sent offers including Broncos, Seahawks and ravens; who all had “trouble” players that do way worse than get political. The problem is Kaepernick peaked and was losing his throwing ability, likely due to injuries such as the torn ligaments in his throwing hand. John Elway is one of three coaches who made an offer but said it didn’t seem like he was actually trying to be on the team. Kaepernick was asking for “peak Colin Kaepernick” money when In reality he showed consecutive years in the bottom percentage of pass completion. For example, in 2016 Eli Manning was making $17.5 million but took a $7 million pay cut cause he knew he wasn’t super bowl Eli anymore. 

Now I’ll put on my tinfoil hat and state my opinion if anyone is still reading or interested. I think Colin truly cared about the movement and did great things with it. However, I believe when his contract ended with SF and no teams were interested in picking him up (due to his poor numbers and age ) he realized this and saw an opportunity to be an activist when Nike reaches out to him, estimated to be around $5 million a year (all the money, none of the concussions!). I truly believe him going to try outs was a publicity stunt to play further into his narrative as a victim of the system.
