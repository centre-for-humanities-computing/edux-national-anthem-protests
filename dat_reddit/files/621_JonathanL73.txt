&gt; Lol, $20 hot dogs = good for business. Denouncing murder = bad for business.
Yeah, fuck the NFL.

I believe in free speech. I don’t really follow football, so I don’t know of NFL’s position on all this. I’m Mexican-American so I completely understand fighting your civil rights as a minority. I just never been comfortable with the protest tactic of refusing to pledge to the flag. I think the method distracts from the message. I completely support the message 110%. Being that I am Mexican-American my perspective is a bit different though. People generally tend to assume Hispanic-Americans as not being American. The default assumption is we’re foreigners and not real Americans. Where-as Black-Americans are generally viewed as American by default but treated as second class citizens or worse. I’m a first-gen born American so while I’m not comfortable with kneeling to the flag itself, I support the freedom to do so.
