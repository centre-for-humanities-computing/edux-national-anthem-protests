Antonio Brown was a top 3 Wide Receiver in the league. He refused to wear a new helmet, got fined, refused to pay fines, threatened to assault the Raiders’ General Manager and called him a cracker. He got kicked off the team. The Patriots still immediately signed him and gave him a chance because he has team-changing talent. And he fucked it up right away lol. 

Kaep just wasn’t the same player he was in 2013. If he was a top 3 QB, the Niners never would have let him go, no matter how much of a media circus it caused. 

But Kaep got BIG money from Nike in 2018 for his activism, much more money than he ever would’ve gotten if he stayed in the league as a backup. So he came out on top.
