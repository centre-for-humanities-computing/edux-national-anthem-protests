I had a teacher in high school whose brother was paralyzed playing HS football. His life was essentially ended at 17 and he suffered for over 20 years, trapped in his own body. Ultimately, he opted for assisted suicide to release himself and his family from the burden or his existence. Completely tragic and unnecessary; I've always hated the violence of the sport because of it.
