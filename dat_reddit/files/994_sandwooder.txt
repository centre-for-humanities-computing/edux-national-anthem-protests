As I said.. Let's be clear that these stadiums are paid for most times by tax payers. These private owners get special privileges to operate in cities. They get police protection for free paid for by tax payers. They get military bands and fly overs for free. 

They are allowed to operate under special allowance by the government.  They are a monopoly.
