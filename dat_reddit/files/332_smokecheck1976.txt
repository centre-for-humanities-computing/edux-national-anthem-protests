That isn't complete.  Kapernick was nowhere near good enough on the upside to be worth the headache on the downside.  To be blunt, a more fair assessment is that Kapernick was not good enough to be a third option or even a practice team quarterback.  He struggled at pre-snap defense reads, he could not read a defense post snap, he rarely looked anywhere other than his first receiver, if his first receiver was covered Kapernick did not step through his options, he pulled the ball down and ran with it.  While he came off the bench for about 6 games one season, once NFL defensive coordinators had an offseason to look at what he was doing, his gig was up.

Since much of Reddit will flatly refuse to believe me, here is all that really needs to be said, these are Kapernick's stats from his last game against a sub-par NFL defense:

 Week 13  12/04/2016  at Chicago Bears  L   6 - 26 1 Completion 5 Attempts 4 total passing yards 0.8 yards per attempt 0 TD 0 INT 5 Sacks 25 Sack Yards 39.6 Passer Rating 6 Rushing Attempts 20 Total Yards 3.3 Yards per attempt 0 TD 1 Fumble 0 Fumbles lost

This is not a QB you want on your team, especially one with the significant baggage hecomes with.
