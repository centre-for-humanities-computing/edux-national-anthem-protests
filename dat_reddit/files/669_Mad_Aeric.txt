There's a reason I specified insuring highschool players. That means no football scholarships, greatly reduced talent pools at the college level (if that even still happens), and thus the NFL is stuck recruiting players who didn't even pick up the sport until fairly recently. I wouldn't bet on that being an especially viable business.
