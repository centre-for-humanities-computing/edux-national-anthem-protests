&gt; It would be 'illegal' if all the teams were talking and together after those talks came to that agreement/conclusion.

Close.  It would be illegal if any two or more teams were talking to each other and agreed to act collectively and deny a player access to a free market.  One of the reasons the league enjoys the legal status is has is that each team has to operate independently in terms of free agency and compensation.  It doesn't have to be the whole league, just any two teams who sit down and say I'm not going to sign that guy and you shouldn't either.
