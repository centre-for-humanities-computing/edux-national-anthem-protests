&gt;Pointing out that the niners went 2-14 is disingenuous. Ownership scrapped the absolute shit out of that team

That's just how it is for QBs. You get credit for the wins regardless of whether it's deserved, and you get blame for the losses regardless of whether it's deserved.

Kaep is often described as a QB who "led a team to the SB," even though he's far less deserving of that credit than Frank Gore or Patrick Willis or Justin Smith or Navarro Bowman or Joe Staley. But he was the QB and they weren't, so suddenly it's "his team" that "he took" to the SB.

Happens all the time. Tom Brady was mediocre in his 1st SB win. Peyton Manning was underwhelming in both of his SB wins. But they got the credit, because they were QBs and Lawyer Milloy and Von Miller weren't.

Flip side of that is the QB gets the blame when the team loses. If Peyton's team loses because the kicker misses a chip shot, Peyton gets the blame. Jimmy G took blame for the SB loss, as if he was the one out there giving up 3rd &amp; 15 conversions.
