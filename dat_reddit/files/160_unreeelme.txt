Most football fans, similar to boxing, ufc are enthralled by physical abuse. 

I remember when I was like 12 years old the big hits made me excited in football, I played, watched. But sometime around 13-14 years old I hit a kid playing damn near knocked myself unconscious. Hit him as soon as he was handed the ball.

The other guy got taken out of the game. 

The parents were cheering on my sideline when it happened then everyone went quiet when they realized he was hurt. 

I was just thinking, this is messed up, and I was only a kid. Around the same time, shortly after, I heard about cte. Saw that bill romanowski 60 minutes when I was like 10 years old, about him not remembering anything and having mood swings.

Now I just watch the super bowl. Stopped following in like 2014. Shit is barbaric in a lot of ways.
