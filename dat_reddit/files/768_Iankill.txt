&gt;This may be the case but what else would these guys be doing? Many of them were passed along through school on the basis of their athleticism and the only thing keeping them attached to school was athletics and the prospect of attaining something better in the future.

This is more of what I'm saying and why these guys are being exploited. First you say well they get a free scholarship so it's okay. 

Now it's well they have nothing else in life so what else would they do. I'm not them I can't answer that question but I guarantee to its not nothing.

This type of thinking reinforces the idea that it's okay to exploit them because they'd have nothing else in life so this is better than that. 

It's similar thought process to how slave owners felt they were doing their slaves a favor by owning them because without them they believe they'd would be wild animals.
