First you say it was a poor team, as if he carried it, then you admit they'd be a playoff contender without him. Very unlikely that both are true.

When he actually had a poor team he struggled massively to win games and got benched. Even with some good fantasy football stats he was still losing.

He stopped winning games and started causing drama. He then decided to sabotage his opportunities to continue playing because he wanted to get paid for creating controversy instead of playing football. It was a smart choice for him financially and health-wise, even if you don't agree with his brand of politics or activism.

He's just as much at fault for his football career ending as the owners and to deny that fact shows a clear bias and lack of critical thinking ability.
