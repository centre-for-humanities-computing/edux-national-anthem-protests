Maybe, maybe not.  Even when this current chaos ends, unless there's some systematic national changes, we'll just be here again in a couple years when another tragedy gets taped in broad daylight.  But that's a completely separate issue from this comment chain where I had an issue with you just telling people to vote with their wallets if they don't' like it.  At least from my POV through my entire life it doesn't make a single bit of a difference.
