It’s a shame the NFL didn’t think using its massive nationwide platform to help generate movement in a positive direction towards a safer country for people of color. Seeing as a good portion of its viewing audience and most of its active participants are indeed people of color. 

Instead it was bad for business and now we are rioting in the streets instead. Good call on that one NFL. I kinda hope your stadiums are the next thing protesters target, maybe you’ll get the point then but I wouldn’t bet on it.
