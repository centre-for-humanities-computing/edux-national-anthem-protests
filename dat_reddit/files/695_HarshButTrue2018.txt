Can you do me a huge favor and ignore what happened when Baltimore tried to sign him?

His gf actively tanking the deal by comparing an owner paying players millions of dollars to a slave owner might hurt your argument. It might make you think he never wanted to actually be signed, and instead wanted to play the martyr role instead.
