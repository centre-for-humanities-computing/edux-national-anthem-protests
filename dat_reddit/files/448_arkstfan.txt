DUH!

Anyone who really follows the NFL knows there is a clear double standard. 

A player not easily replaced can get away with pretty much anything as long as they aren’t incarcerated.  

Kaepernick wasn’t seen as that sort of player and AS ALWAYS whenever a protest involves the flag it is quickly capitalized on as hate for America and contempt for the military. He was officially “more trouble than he was worth.” 

Tom Brady five years ago? It would have been all about his courage of convictions. 

Instead we got the Vice-President stealing headlines from the day Manning was to be honored in Indianapolis by going out of his way to walk out of the game and become the story rather than Manning.
