What are you even arguing? You said he couldn't have created an event on short notice (7 days to gather some friends and tell the media where to go) and I rebutted with the fact that a series of massive protests across an entire country was staged in less time.

You don't think he already had a set PR plan? Do you think he's just some dumbass who is flying by the seat of his pants and didn't have a plan? He started a national protest during NFL games, he was all over the media during this from tv interviews to magazine cover stories, Nike launched and has expanded a civil rights line under his image, and he was popping up all over the nation selling his brand. It's ignorant to think he did not have a plan in place and a team of people advising him on it.
