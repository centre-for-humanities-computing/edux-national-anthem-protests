Sorry and sorry to anyone I’ve offended. My observation is taken across a number of years of watching (around ten that some of the games have been broadcast in Australia). Two things, I’ve noticed teams like New England for example and Green Bay and New York, even New Orleans have some very clear delineations more recently. I didn’t notice 10 years ago, but it is very obvious now. These are my observations and are limited to the games we get to see here then and now. 

Again, I’m sorry for offending anyone (or everyone).
