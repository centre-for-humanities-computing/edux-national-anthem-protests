Man, you have a quote from an a recent NFL VP saying it wasn't because of his talent but the controversy he brought, yet you still doubt. 

I'm a huge NFL fan and I'm racking my brain trying to think who Eric Reid is and who he plays/played for.

Meanwhile every man, woman in child in America knows Kaepernick and has an opinion on him. Not the case for Reid. 

The idea that Kaepernick wasn't good enough to be a backup or even third string QB somewhere by talent is pretty damn preposterous. Anyone who makes that argument basically is revealing that they don't know what they're talking  about when it comes to football.

Don't take my word for it, you now have the word from the horse's mouth, a former NFL executive.
