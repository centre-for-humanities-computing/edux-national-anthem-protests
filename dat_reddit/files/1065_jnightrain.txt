As a backup and the Kaeps gf called ray Lewis an Uncle Tom essentially proving the point that he wasn't worth the headache to be an NFL backup. Same thing that happened to Tebow who was not a NFL starting QB but good enough to be a backup.

Kaep started protesting after he was benched. OP is correct that Kaep didn't start protesting until his career was on its way down.
