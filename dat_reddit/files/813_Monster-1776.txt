Plaintiff lawyer here, that's no how that works, in just about every situation where it's an individual suing an entity, the lawyer is paid on a contingency fee which means they get a percentage of whatever is recovered. Can guarantee with it being an employment law issue that Kaepernick's lawyers were working on contingency.
