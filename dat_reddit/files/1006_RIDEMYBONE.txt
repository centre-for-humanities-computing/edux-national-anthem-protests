Come on my guy, you’re better than this. Kap took over for a QB that was ranked third in the league at the time, on a team that was 8-2-1. My grandmother could have taken that monster team to the super bowl that year. Matt  Cassel went 11-5 with the Patriots when Tom Brady went down. You going to tell me he’s a goos QB next?
