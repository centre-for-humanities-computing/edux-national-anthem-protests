I like how your example has the NBA refusing to take the opposing side, the side where cops don’t murder innocent people SHOULD be good for business and you just helped make it abundantly clear that NFL fans are mostly a racists cancer that the league bows down to. 

Stop supporting a league that doesn’t value human life over $$$
