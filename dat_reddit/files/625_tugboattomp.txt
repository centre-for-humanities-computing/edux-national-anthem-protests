My childhood bud played from Pop Warner on thru H.S. 5'6" bulit like a fireplug, played center quite well, a real brute always led with his hed. 

Now at nearly 60, sometimes he's out walking about and he suddenly forgets where he is. Had to retire early from nuclear x ray tech cuz he started confusing numbers
