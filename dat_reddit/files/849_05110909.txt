No, I'm not ignoring that. That's why I said athletics loses money, not that football loses money. Football and men's basketball are pretty much the only two sports that have a positive revenue stream. They subsidize all other athletics. The reason you can get a scholarship for gymnastics or volleyball or whatever is because of those two sports.

Personally I don't see anything immoral or unethical when a school makes profit on their athletics in a single year. But regardless, the vast majority of schools lose money on their sports contrary to the popular misconception.
