QB rating is not the be-all-end-all... But mostly because it makes mobile QBs who run well like Kaepernick look WORSE than they are.

His QBR (which is a much better measure of passer value) 

ESPN's proprietary QBR better than QB rating? Literally the first time I've heard anyone outside of ESPN who believes this. I'm actually kind of blown away, I have a hard time believing your opinion is based in anything other than it furthers your narrative. 

All you need to know QBR is suspect is that a huge part of its calculation is a "clutch" factor. "Clutch" is a thoroughly debunked concept in sports by legitimate statisticians.

QBR makes decent QBs on bad teams (like 2016 Kaepernick) look worse, and mediocre QBs on good teams look better than they are.
