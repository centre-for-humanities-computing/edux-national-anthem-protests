Poor SF team? Are you fucking high? They had peak Gore and Vernon Davis, prime Staley. That defense was stacked with Willis, Justin Smith and company.

He did what average QBs are expected to do: not lose when you have a strong running game and dominant defense. Same thing Jimmy G did, until he didn't.
