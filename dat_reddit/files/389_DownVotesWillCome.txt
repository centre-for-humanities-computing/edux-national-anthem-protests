Look Yep. Stadium food is a perfect bubble of free market. One could argue there isn’t any competition so it’s a monopoly. That’s kinda moot though when you look at the average length of a ballgame. You are there for a few hours at most. Eat before you go and after you leave if you want. They only sell it because people will buy it.
