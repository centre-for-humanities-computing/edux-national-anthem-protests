This is at least the second time you've said this in this thread, and now you're adding erroneous commentary of your own. So for the sake of stopping the misinformation:

&gt;[Colin Kaepernick's first workout with an NFL team since he became a free agent more than a year ago was nixed by the Seattle Seahawks after the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback refused to say whether he planned to continue to kneel during the national anthem, a person with knowledge of the discussions told USA TODAY Sports.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/seahawks/2018/04/12/colin-kaepernick-seattle-seahawks-protest-national-anthem/511389002/) 

&gt;The Seahawks were slated to work out Kaepernick on Monday, a meeting that was scheduled about two weeks prior without any mention of kneeling, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. Seattle then inquired late last week about his plans on further protests.

&gt;Kaepernick's response: He was focused on football and wasn't going to agree to preconditions. 

&gt;A short time later, the Seahawks called off the workout.
