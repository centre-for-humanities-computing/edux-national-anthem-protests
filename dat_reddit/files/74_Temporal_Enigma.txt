People also forget how the Ravens were going to sign him, then his girlfriend called the owners "Slavers" and they backed out real quick. 

He also wouldn't take a backup job, demanded a starter salary and wouldn't take a 1 year deal. He was already being swapped for Blaine Gabbert before the kneeling and then after that season ended, he left in free agency and demanded a ton of money. Teams were ready to sign him, but didn't want to shell out on an expensive, backup caliber QB. 

The AAF and XFL both tried to sign him, but he demanded more than the league's were worth.
