&gt;youâ€™d have to build an offense around him as he is not a pro style qb (midline option, rpo stuff since be liked to run a bit... which was honestly the best part of his game).

There's a lot of criticism you can say about Kaepernick's game, but this isn't one of them. Good teams and good coaches try to build their team around their leaders in a way that would help them succeed. For example, Lamar Jackson isn't your traditional "pro style" quarterback, but the Ravens got incredible success from him this past year by building a team around his style of play. Nick Foles had one of the most iconic Super Bowl runs of all time by allowing him to constantly run the RPO. Every Seahawks fan knows that they try to run a "pro style" offense until the 4th quarter when they're losing and need Russell Wilson to bail them out.

Not wanting to build around a quarterback is honestly a rookie mistake.
