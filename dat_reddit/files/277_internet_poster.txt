&gt; Kaepernick's final season he was rated 90.7, which was above his career average so the idea his play had declined significantly isn't supported by facts.

His QBR was awful in each of his last two seasons in the league.  He was 30th in 2015 and 22nd in 2016, versus 4th in a half season in 2012 and 8th in 2013.  He basically went from a Pro Bowl-level QB to one of the worst starters in the league.
