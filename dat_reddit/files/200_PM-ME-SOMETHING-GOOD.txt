I think him sitting on the bench is exactly why it would be a good decision. You attract the woke crowd just by the decision to have him on the team, and you avoid offending the sizable portion of your fans that hate him too much because they won't have to see him often. The media attention alone would bring quite a lot of value to the team. I'm not saying they'd get thousands of new regular watchers, but the value of their business would go up, opposite of what they thought would happen if Kaepernick joined.
