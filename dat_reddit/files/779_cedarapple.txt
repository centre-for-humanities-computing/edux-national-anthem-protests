I guess that I don't see them as being exploited, when they are given educations (and degrees if they finish) worth in excess of $200k in exchange for playing sports that I assume that they like doing and (unlike slaves) they have a choice to participate.  How would this be different than a talented pianist who gets a scholarship based on musical ability or a braniac coder or physics major who gets a scholarship?  I'm honestly open to your thoughts on this.
