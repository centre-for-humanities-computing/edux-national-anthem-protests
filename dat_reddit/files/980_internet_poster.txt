&gt; But mostly because it makes mobile QBs who run well like Kaepernick look WORSE than they are.

Not necessarily.  Kaepernick fumbled 9 times in 2016 and got sacked another 36 times.  None of this shows up in passer rating.  In aggregate Kaepernick's passer rating from 2016 is pretty decent because he had very few interceptions, but was terrible at moving the ball.

It's also not like QBR is an outlier here.  ANY/A is also a much more sensible weighting for QB stats than passer rating and it suggests that Kaepernick was even worse in his final two seasons (33rd and 23rd, respectively) and even better in his first two seasons (2nd in 2012 and 8th in 2013).

It's very clear that Kaepernick was a much less effective quarterback in 2016 than he was early in his career.  

&gt; All you need to know QBR is suspect is that a huge part of its calculation is a "clutch" factor. "Clutch" is a thoroughly debunked concept in sports by legitimate statisticians.

This is false.  ["Unlike the initial version of QBR released in 2011, plays are no longer up-weighted for â€œclutch situations,"](https://www.espn.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/123701/how-is-total-qbr-calculated-we-explain-our-quarterback-rating)

&gt; Even with the highly suspect QBR stat your conclusion is that he's at the bottom end of starters... And bottom end starters make millions of dollars per year as bad starters or good backups.

Kaepernick was certainly better than players like Blake Bortles, Case Keenum, and Brock Osweiler, 2 of whom remain on NFL rosters to this day.  But there's also this weird strain of Kaepernick trutherism that insists he was a totally solid NFL starter or even (in your case) he was playing at the same level as he was early in his career.  You can reasonably conclude that he was blacklisted without having to make that absurd argument.
