Holy shit stop comparing Kaep to Tebo. Tebo was only kept around for his image.  Tebo was not good at outside of college. Backup quarterbacks still have to be good because injuries are common even for quarterbacks. Tebo was 3/4th string at best. 

I feel like this is obvious to anyone that watched football. Makes me think people are purposely trying to make Kaep a worse player than he actually was. And yes Kaep past his peak was waaaaay better than Tebo.
