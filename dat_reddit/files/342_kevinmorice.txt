I am in the UK, so don't see any more than you do. I just think you maybe should take a closer look at the validity of your statement. 

With respect to Head Coaches, the numbers are imbalanced, but a lot of that is genuine based on the best person for the job and you need a certain level of seniority and experience to get that job, and things were imbalanced 10-20 years ago and that is going to take time to resolve. 

But the statements on players just aren't true.
