I completely agree with that. I just think it’s a combination of racism with the fact that police are able to do things like no knock raids that get them in situations where they disproportionately kill black people, so the solution would need to address both.

I won’t pretend to be smart enough to come up with the best solution but I think it would be a start to implement measures that hold police accountable, including:

- Truly independent internal investigations; no more investigating themselves

- Culture change in police training. From what I’ve read police are trained with the mindset that they’re going to war; “us vs them” instead of on the same side as the community they protect. Deescalation training and maybe make the process to become a cop take longer than 6 months.

- malpractice insurance like medical practitioners carry, paid for personally. When a cop is sued their insurance pays any settlements (instead of taxpayer dollars like now), and the cops insurance premiums go up, pricing them out of police work after multiple lawsuits. They need to be personally accountable rather than just having the taxpayer foot the bill.
