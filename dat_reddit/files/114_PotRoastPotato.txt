Kaepernick was leaps and bound better than Tebow.

Going by QB rating, Kaepernick's career rating was 88.9 (roughly an average NFL starter), Tebow's career rating was 75.3 (which is putrid, it's why he's out of the league).

Kaepernick's final season he was rated 90.7, which was above his career average so the dies his play had declined significantly isn't supported by facts.
