"Because in reality, a lot of people with preexisting health conditions weren't allowed to drink and therefore fell in that 'dont drink wine' section."
That's incorrect.There are a multitude of factors that could be at play. Not just one. That's why you'd start discounting for various other factors, not just one. As such, what you said was incorrect. 

"Just because the statistics show that more black people are convicted for crimes, does not mean black people are more likely to commit crimes."

Yes, that's why you use the murder rate as the best indicator of violent crime as it is more or less universally reported. One racial cohort commits more murder than ALL of the rest of society. 

The narrative that police are disproportionately targeting black people just doesn't line up.

Your belief here is based on emotion, not data.
