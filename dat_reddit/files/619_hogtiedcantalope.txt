Was this not obvious to everyone at the time?

The NFL would much rather have stayed far away from this controversial subject. It was always in the NFLs interest to not split their fan base down racial/political lines. Kaepernick as an employee of the NFL was getting paid at those games behaving in a way that they felt was detremental to the bottom line. So he was fired like anyone employee would be if the company felt they were losing money by employing them.

He has really skyrocketed in fame through all this. And now he has a voice and an audience in or out of the NFL. Interested to see what he could do with it independent of football.
