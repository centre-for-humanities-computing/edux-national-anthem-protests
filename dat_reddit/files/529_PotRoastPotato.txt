For the record, you think a 90.6 QB rating, 16 TDs and 4 INTs is *bad*? 

The other QB who started for the 49ers that year threw more INTs in 5 starts than Kaepernick threw in 11 starts. 

It's a team sport, and he was on a horrible team. Team W-L is not an argument whether or not a QB is good enough to be in the NFL.
