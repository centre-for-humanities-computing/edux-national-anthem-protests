This isn’t entirely true. There was a team that offered Kaepernick a contract the very next season and no one ever mentions it. 

The Denver Broncos offered Kap a contract worth (iirc) about $11 million a year just after he was cut. Kap thought he was worth $18 million a year. The Broncos were looking to sign Kap rather than pay Brock Osweiler. Kap decided to hold out for a better offer that never came. Keep in mind, even this short few years ago, QB salaries were very different. There was a “middle class” when it came to QB talent (there isn’t one now). Most Broncos fans like myself viewed Osweiller as a better option than Kaepernick at the time. 

Some say that the Broncos lowballed Kap, but the Broncos also lowballed Osweiller, apparently. Remember that Osweiller was coming off of a Super Bowl 50 season in which he had successfully backed up (and had outplayed) Peyton Manning.  Osweiller started about 4 games that year, I believe. The Broncos offered Osweiller $16 million, but he left and took $18 million from the Texans.
