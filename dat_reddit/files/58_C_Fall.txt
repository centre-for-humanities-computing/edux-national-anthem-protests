I think you’re wrong in the sense that Kaep wasn’t a starting QB in the league but he certainly wasn’t a top 15 QB at the time. Mix that with the protesting and of course he didn’t get re-signed anywhere. I’m with Kaep and his movement. I believe he’s in the right. But don’t blame anyone but himself for being out of the league. He knew what he was doing. He knew he wasn’t going to have a long career in the NFL. He saw his shot and took it and he’s good at that. Glad he took his shot.
