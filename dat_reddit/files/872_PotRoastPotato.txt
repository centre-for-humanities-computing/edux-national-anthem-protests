You can gatekeep how big a fan I am becuse I wasn't familiar with the 2nd leading tackler on the Carolina Panthers, whatever, but if I couldn't remember who he was, when I watch more football than I'm proud of, then I guarantee he's not a household name like Kaepernick. 

And even before he was a household name, a good defensive player is has WAY less fame and recognition than a QB who led a marquee franchise like the 49ers to the Super Bowl.
