A police state? Oh you must be triggered. No we don't live in a police state. 

The correct way to protest? Like an NFL quarterback doing his job and then using the massive platform that he has to reach out to the community for whatever purpose he wants? Yeah, that won't work. I mean, social media doesn't exist, right?
