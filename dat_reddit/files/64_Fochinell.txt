&gt; Pointing out that the niners went 2-14 is disingenuous. 

Okay, I’ll blame the execrable Niners front office for their part but they weren’t the ones who somehow made Kaepernick run around in circles in the pocket for five seconds after the snap like Curly from the *Three Stooges* going “Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!” and ultimately finishing the play by either running for -3 yards, throwing with a wide open sidearm wobbly duck pass that would either wildly miss the intended receiver or bounce off the opposing team’s sideline Gatorade cooler, get picked off, perform illegal grounding, or get saaaaacked like the Packers did to him six times in one game.

What happened to Kaepernick is that he got figured out by the whole league.
