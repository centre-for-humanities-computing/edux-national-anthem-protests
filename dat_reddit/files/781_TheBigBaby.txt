&gt; a government that exercises power arbitrarily through the power of the police force.

Like arbitrarily murdering unarmed civilians?


&gt; The inhabitants of a police state may experience restrictions on their mobility

My city is under curfew from dusk til dawn.

&gt; or on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement.

The cops are literally targeting journalists for trying to show the world what they’re currently doing.

Do they need to just start openly kidnapping people for you to think they’ve gone too far?
