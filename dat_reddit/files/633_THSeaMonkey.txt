After the new stadium in Atlanta opened, more and more teams are dropping their prices. After the success with the Falcons cheap menu, even my home team lowered it's prices. Granted it's still $8 for a burger and fries or $10 for a chicken platter, it's not horribly overpriced like before. At least in this specific instant, management seems have more realistic idea of what people want. Now ticket prices on the other hand, that's a fucking racket.
