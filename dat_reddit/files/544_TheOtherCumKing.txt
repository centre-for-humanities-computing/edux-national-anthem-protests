The whole point of protests is to change the system, not to oblige by it. Just because something is illegal, doesn't mean it's wrong. 

Women protested for the right to vote, black people protested for the right to be seen as human beings, gay people protested for the right to get married. All of these things were illegal. Should they have said, 'Well the law says it illegal for me to do these things, so clearly I'm in the wrong here. Ah well!'.
