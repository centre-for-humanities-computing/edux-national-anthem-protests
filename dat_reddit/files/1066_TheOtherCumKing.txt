In a survey of people who drink wine and those that do not, the statistics showed that people who drank wine lived longer. 

Just because the numbers show that, it does not mean that drinking wine is good for you. Because in reality, a lot of people with preexisting health conditions weren't allowed to drink and therefore fell in that 'dont drink wine' section.

Just because the statistics show that more black people are convicted for crimes, does not mean black people are more likely to commit crimes. There are a multitude of factors you have to consider when interpreting statistics and what they mean. 

And that's why people often say causation does not equal correlation. 

I also highly doubt that you haven't been explained the reasoning behind those numbers before and aren't choosing to purposely ignore what they mean. 

I mean just take two seconds to think on this, your argument against black people being disproportionately targeted by the police is that stats show the police arrests more black people.
