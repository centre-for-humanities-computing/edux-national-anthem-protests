32 teams worth about $75 billion.  The top two teams in terms of worth have owners who are friendly to or friends of the President.  I wrote this over in r/pics.  Here is the relevant part:

The politicians seeing an opportunity, painted an expression of free speech into something akin to burning the flag and weaponized sports into politics.

“Wouldn’t you love to see one of those N.F.L. owners, when someone disrespects our flag, to say: ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’ ” -- Trump on Kapernick. Huntsville, Alabama rally, September 2017

And people believed it.

Please, go vote in November.
