Hard to side with Kaepernick here.  Can't think of any employer who allows their employee to during work hours and using work premises use it for pushing political views.  Most work places try to stay away from these things and be neutral and just focus on the business at hand.

I would side with Kaep more if he did his stuff outside of work.  He is already a celebrity and played in the Superbowl so he already has a platform he can use.  Doesn't have to be a work platform.
