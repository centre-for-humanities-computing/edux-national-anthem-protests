Lol your first post mentioned it was a very respectful protest, now your saying protests ( including his by proxy) are not respectful. Nice contradiction Einstein.

Thing is, there are respectful ways to protest, and there are non respectful ways. You choose the latter since you enjoy the rush from being a prick. Meanwhile the rest of us look at you and other children derailing progress cause you want to flex.

Quit excusing shitty behavior to feed your emotional side, you know how to act-just do it ™️
