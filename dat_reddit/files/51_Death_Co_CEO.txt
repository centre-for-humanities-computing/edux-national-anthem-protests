No one in any business wants people who rock the boat, let's say you go all in in him and then eventually he says something stupid just one thing suddenly you are now associated with that you dont want to be. I really feel for the guy, and he is going about everything in the right way. But no one wants to rock the boat, because if you do it may turn upside down
