Good enough to be on a roster. Not good enough to take a starting position along with bringing in controversy.

We literally have starting qbs taking back positions or not even playing. But the nfl should pay someone middle of the pack? Why?

Remember when Kap was given a practice so teams could scout him and he decided to do it hours away? Who wants a player like that?
