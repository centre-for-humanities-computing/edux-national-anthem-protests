Kaepernick is a working class Hero! 
Personally, at events when the frivolous action of singing an irrelevant song and the worship of a cloth made in China is conducted. I stay seated and uninvolved. Been doing it ever since Vietnam Nam. The flag no longer represents the people. It represents criminals, murderers, sexual deviates of an odious, vile so called government.
