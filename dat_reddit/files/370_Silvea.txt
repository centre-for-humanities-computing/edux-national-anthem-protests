This isn’t even an argument about whether he was wrong to take that stance. I completely agree with what is being said here. I for one agree with his cause, but the way he chose to promote it caused a lot of issues. 

It’s a pretty obvious problem what is going on when it comes to black men and the police. I applaud that he chose to make a stand for it, it’s a great cause. He picked something he knew would be insanely controversial because that would get his message out. The problem with that is the backlash from what a lot of Americans saw as “disrespecting the flag, the nation, and the soldiers who have fought and died for that flag”. 

Now some people didn’t care, a lot of people did care. Had he done something like wore an arm band of a certain color and brought attention to that’s why he was wearing it and that anyone who wanted to join in solidarity for this cause should wear the same, I think his message would have been welcomed with a warm response. Instead he chose something that in itself caused a lot of controversy and that detracted away from his message. 

It’s no secret that people were upset with him kneeling. I’ve seen people who go to games in wheel chairs that with assistance stand for the anthem. The NFL got a lot of backlash not because of the message but how he got it out there. He painted himself a pariah. Any team that took him on knew that any fans that were angered by his form of protest, would look unfavorably at them. 

TLDR: It’s obvious that with the amount of controversy his protest brought that no team was willing to bring it to their stadium. Any team that signed him would be seen as endorsing his kneeling. That would be bad for business and that’s what they are there for... if he had chosen another way to protest that people didn’t see as disrespectful it would have likely gone over much better. No one hated him for his cause, they hated the way he chose to promote it.
