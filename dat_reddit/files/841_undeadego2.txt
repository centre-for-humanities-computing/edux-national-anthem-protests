Donald is correct here. No position? Pretty clear this is a statement of empathy and understanding, and a degree of wisdom that might be useful in current circumstance. Looks like a clear position to me that current events are the result of pent up frustration.

But:

Go ahead and try to stop funding these stadiums. Most, btw, are built in Blue cities: San Fran, LA, Seattle, Baltimore, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Foxboro,,... list is long.  So while your Democrat masters make tax break deals with the NFL you can continue to vote for them and get rekt.

Good luck with that. But the argument that the NFL has no right to edge Kaepernick out is flawed and hypocritical when it is tied to Free Speech debate. If Twitter can ban users for making political statements that don't jive with their organization's political leanings, so can the NFL. Be consistent.

You're introducing a red herring here with your George Bush nonsense. You've made no argument and your post is just gibbering as far as that goes.
