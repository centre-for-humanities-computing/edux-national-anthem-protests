His athletic ability wasn’t it. His QB ability was why he didn’t get another job. He’s a very good athlete, he just couldn’t get a job as a QB. You clearly know nothing about football and that’s okay. What’s not okay is your racism assuming I’m white because I gave a football evaluation on Kaepernick. Racist.
