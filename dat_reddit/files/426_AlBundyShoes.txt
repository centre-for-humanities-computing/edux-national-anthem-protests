And he was. And still is.  And he’s not a very good quarterback and you’d have to build an offense around him as he is not a pro style qb (midline option, rpo stuff since be liked to run a bit... which was honestly the best part of his game).

He also thinks he should be paid multiple millions.. he’s a train wreck when it comes to the NFL.  Just look at that spectacle of a workout he put on.
