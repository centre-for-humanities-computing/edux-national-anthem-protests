Just because our current, bloated, broken, bastardized system churns through capital in some departments doesn't mean the idea of taxation towards a good goal is wasted. Roads, Schools, Universal Healthcare, Socialized retirement funds, all sound like pretty good things I would be happy to contribute my fair share of taxes to. If we collectively want to change things for the better, we can't axe ideas that work well just because they were implemented poorly by the wrong people.
