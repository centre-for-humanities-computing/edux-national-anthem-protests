&gt;the ~~fact~~ misguided opinion [that] we live in a police state 

FTFY.

A police state is a government that exercises power arbitrarily through the power of the police force. ... The inhabitants of a police state may experience restrictions on their mobility, or on their freedom to express or communicate political or other views, which are subject to police monitoring or enforcement.

The cops are not the gestapo dispatched by the feds to silence undesirables. Hyperbole like that only fans the flames of ignorant rage.
