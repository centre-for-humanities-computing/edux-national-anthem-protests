I remember the coach telling us that you had to hurt the opposing player to instil dominance. That, and that most players of the best team he had ever coached were doing their second tour of duty in Vietnam. NOT inspirational in those days. I did get a "transient" back injury which showed a compressed disc on X-ray four years later when it started to bother me again but at least we won that game, ooh rah!. It was one year and done to go surfing instead partly because to play basketball, which I think is a great sport, you had to get a short haircut in those days.
