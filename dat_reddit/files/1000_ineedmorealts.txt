&gt; The riots are hat bad because cops are immediately aggressive unaccountable thugs

No it's a lack of power. triple or more their man power and give them rifles and future riots will be less successful 

&gt; If they didnt act like an occupying paramilitary group we wouldnt have this

No you'd have much worse rioting and looting.
