&gt;I'm a huge NFL fan and I'm racking my brain trying to think who Eric Reid is and who he plays/played for.

You're obviously not that big a fan if you don't know who Reid is, seeing as he's a better player than Kaep was.

Reid had 130 tackles last year, trailing only Luke Kuechly (who will be a unanimous 1st ballot HOFer) for CAR.
