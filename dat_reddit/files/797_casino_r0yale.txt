I stopped watching football after my first game. Now I only watch at Super Bowl parties. 10 seconds of action and 3 minutes of commercials. Fuck that. World of difference between that and a 45 minute soccer half. Basketball is becoming similarly unbearable. Hockey is the only popular sport in the US thatâ€™s bearable.
