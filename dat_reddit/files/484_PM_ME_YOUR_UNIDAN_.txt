I really don’t understand where this expectation for large corporations to be wholesome to their customers comes from. The only humans they have an obligation to treat fairly are their employees. Everything else is fair game as long as it isn’t unlawful. There is nothing scummy about these practices because the choice still lies with you, the consumer. No one else.
