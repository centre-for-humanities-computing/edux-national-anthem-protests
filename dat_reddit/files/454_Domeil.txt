I have some honest questions.

Why, in your opinion, is it okay for the NFL to politicize football by accepting millions of dollars to advertise the armed forces with flag displays and air force flyovers? (Prior to 2009, the teams weren't even on the field during the anthem) Given that the sport has already been politicized by the NFL, why is it not okay for Kaepernick to be political in a peaceful and unobtrusive manner when it seems that the issue is not with the fact that he's taking a stance, but that he's taking the "wrong" stance?
