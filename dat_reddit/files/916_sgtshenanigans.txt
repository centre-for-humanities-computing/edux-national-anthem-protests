I just want to say that Malcolm Jenkins who at the time was a member of the Philadelphia Eagles and is not a member of the New Orleans Saints also protested during the anthem and was largely supported by the team, front office, ownership, and fans. He also used his platform and protest to organize the [players Coalition](https://players-coalition.org/about/) which works for Police &amp; Community relations as well as Criminal Justice Reform. If you want a hero from the anthem protests I believe Jenkins is your guy.
