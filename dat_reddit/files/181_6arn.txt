Heck he was given a shot to workout in front of execs from 25 different teams.  Instead of working out at the agreed upon spot he informed them he was changing the facility to one 50 miles away 30 minutes before the start time.  Then at that new facility he had a whole entourage of people wearing pro Kaepernick stuff (meaning the whole thing was premeditated) and at the end made a speech deriding NFL ownership.  

He doesn't want to be a QB anymore.  He just pretends he does for the publicity.  Being blackballed is exactly what he wanted and continues to want.
