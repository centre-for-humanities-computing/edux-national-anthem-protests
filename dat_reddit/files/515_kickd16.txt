My brother had chronic knee issues from football. And the kicker for this is that he never even made it all the way through his freshman football camp. He got tackled from the side in the first week and tore his ACL. After the first surgery went badly he tore it again just walking after he was supposed to be healed and eventually ended up with 7 surgeries stemming from that one initial football injury.
