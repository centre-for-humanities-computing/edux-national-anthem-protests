The NHL has an older average retirement age than the NFL. Most NHL player careers last longer than NFL. Having played both sports as a kid I can say with certainty that hockey is a much safer sport. Not perfect but much safer. There's no such thing as a perfectly safe sport and everything in life has some degree of risk but football is guaranteed repetitive head trauma. It's literally your job to slam your head into other players heads. It's insane that we let our kids still play it.
