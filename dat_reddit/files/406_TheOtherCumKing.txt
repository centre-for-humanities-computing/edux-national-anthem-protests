You don't get to protest at work? 

How the hell do you think you managed to get adequate working conditions in the first place? 

Or what do you think a 'protest' is? 

As for people watching football, of course they don't want to think about black people being killed while enjoying a nice game. In fact, they would rather not think about it at all. 

But that's not the luxury that black people are afforded. So if they want change, they have to force people in to thinking about it. 

So I'm sorry that you hate feeling slightly uncomfortable before a game starts. But learn to have some fucking perspective.
