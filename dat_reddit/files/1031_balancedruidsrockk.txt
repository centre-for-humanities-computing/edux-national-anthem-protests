He wasn’t worth millions of dollars. He wasn’t good. He was average. 

If he was good, the controversy wouldn’t matter. We literally have murderers, wife beaters, child abusers in the NFL. Expect ray lewis, ray rice, Adrian Peterson were all good players and their controversy was pushed aside because of how good they were.

Kap wasn’t good enough to outshine his controversy. And he chose his controversy over his nfl career. 

Antonio brown goes insane and bill belicheck still signs him. Why? Because he was sooo good, it didn’t matter what he did off the field. 

He just wasn’t good enough. He isn’t worth millions of dollars.
