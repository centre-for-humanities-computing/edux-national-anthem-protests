That's the thing though, he's not a back up QB. Harbaugh knew how to use his strengths, and he did great, took the 49ers to a superbowl. The new coach didn't play to his strengths, and the rift caused him to switch to Gabbert (who is no longer the 49ers starting QB). A good coach doesn't build plays around what he wants to do, he builds them around what his players are good at. 

If you compare Tebow and Kap, who both want to be starting QBs, Tebow is wayyyy worse. Like he can't throw. He has great legs and can hold the ball, and when the Pats picked up Tebow, they wanted him as a fullback, where he probably would have lead the league in touchdowns, but he refused, and wanted to be a QB. Kap, with the right coach, would probably still be a consistent play off QB. Honestly, with his arm, I'm shocked the Pats haven't tried to pick him up now that Brady is gone. 

Honestly, controversy can sell. It just depends on the type. A kneeling protest, that can sell, because you'll get people like Mike Pence buying tickets to just walk out if they kneel, but they bought tickets (yes, i know Mike Pence didn't buy the tickets, but people like him will). Illegal stuff, like beating a girlfriend or murder (ala Aaron Hernandez), that makes it hard to sell tickets.
