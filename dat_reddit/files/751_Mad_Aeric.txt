Brain science is complicated, and I have less faith than you do that a treatment will be worked out that will satisfy the requirements to keep high school football viable. Hell, contact sports are off the table for people with hiv, even though modern medications can render it nontransmissiable. Any CTE regimen would have to be perfectly effective, prophylactic, and affordable.

Of course, it can be less perfect with the adult recruitment strategy, but would you expect their empire to keep chugging along with HS/college level talent alone? Because that's all that will be available, aside from the ocasional prodigy. Possibly at a much reduced level, if things go well for them.

CTE treatments will probably keep other brain damage sports like pro wrestling and boxing viable, but I just don't see it working out for football.
