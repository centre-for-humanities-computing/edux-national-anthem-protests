thats just incorrect. the first reported case of CTE wasn't reported until 2005, by that time I was already playing college ball. I am glad I didn't have to join the military, it was either scholarship or military and I definitely wouldn't be where I'm at now had I enlisted, I would of never met my wife, probably wouldn't be sitting in this house etc etc
