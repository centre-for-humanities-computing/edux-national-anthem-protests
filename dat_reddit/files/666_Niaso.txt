I didn't say anything about taxes. I'm just saying NFL fans are not a "captive audience" as the poster stated. An example of a captive audience is someone sitting in a lecture for College Composition because it's a required course for all college students. The only people watching an NFL game as a captive audience are people who work for the teams or broadcasting station that are required to watch as part of their job.
