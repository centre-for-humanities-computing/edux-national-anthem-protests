you are overlooking the fact that no one cared if he was a good player or not, they were upset that he kneeled.  millions of angry white people who didnt give a fuck about football, raging that a black man kneeled durring the anthem.

none of the controversy was over how he played or didnt play football.  stop pretending its relevant.
