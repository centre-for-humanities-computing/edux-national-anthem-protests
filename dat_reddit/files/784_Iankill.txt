&gt;I guess that I don't see them as being exploited, when they are given educations (and degrees if they finish) worth in excess of $200k in exchange for playing sports that I assume that they like doing and (unlike slaves) they have a choice to participate.

As I've said before those education are worth less they what they would be getting paid otherwise it's a cheap deal for the schools. Not all college athletes get scholarships either in fact only 2% do yet you're acting like they all get a free ride.

&gt;How would this be different than a talented pianist who gets a scholarship based on musical ability or a braniac coder or physics major who gets a scholarship?

If a braniac coder invents a million dollar app he gets to keep the money not the school. College athletes are worth millions of dollars to schools in terms of donations, advertising and countless other revenue streams that the players see none of. 

Do you see the difference there even i did this while I was in school as a programmer before I graduated i was a junior developer at a local company. I was able to make money with my skills and support myself. 

A college athlete is preventing from doing that until they finish college that's what the issue is. They cannot use their most valuable skills to earn money for themselves until they go pro.
