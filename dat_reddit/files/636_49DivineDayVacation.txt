And now youâ€™re seeing NFL build that same offense around QBs like Dak Prescott and NFL MVP Lamar Jackson. Kaepernick went through three head coaches in three years: Harbaugh, Tomsula and Chip Kelly. In his final season, he was recovering from three surgeries and Kelly (also in his final season of NFL football) started Gabbert over him so he got no preseason reps in his third new system. Very, very few QBs would survive that carousel man.
