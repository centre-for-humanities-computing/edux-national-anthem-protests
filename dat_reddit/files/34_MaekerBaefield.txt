You’re either lying about being a huge NFL fan or not knowing Eric Reid. You’re lying about one of them. He was basically the second biggest in the protests and has been a starter in the league since he entered the NFL 

And I said I don’t think he was a starting QB. He would have been one of the better backups in the league no doubt. Easily top 5 backup. Teams deal with media personalities for starters. Teams don’t do the same for backups. That’s not unique to this situation. That doesn’t means he was intentionally blackballed. Means he didn’t fit in anywhere
