I'm not directly opposed to this idea, but it has to be done correctly. The sports complex in my city drives more public transport infrastructure, businesses thrive in that area, provides a fantastic spot for community events, and is an overall fun place year round. I have no qualms with my tax dollars being allocated for this, as long as it's done with correct oversight. For example, a  portion of funds were specifically budgeted for geothermal heating and solar panels in my town.  All this goes out the window  though when asshole owners and crooked policitians ruin things like in St Louis.
