I most likely have CTE myself. According to docs, I so far check all the boxes but can’t confirm until my body checks out. Damn, when I read about Junior...a super nice dude, helluva player, a seriously little-understood tragedy, makes me tear up. I love football as much as the next guy, if not more. Used to play, got my bell rung pretty good a few times. Before that, Babe Ruth baseball...took a line drive to the right temple and lights out, waking up to my coach (a BIG boy) holding my head to his chest and rubbing the injury area vigorously. Not to mention my abusive, drunken dad used to really pound me at the ears (moderately severe-to-severe hearing impairment both ears since birth but this was in early ‘60s when a little kid-not much was understood even then-he died in ‘97 and I’ve long forgiven him...he had bad hurts like all the rest of us). Military and 35 year fire-EMS career both came with their own sets of head injury (and PTSD) dynamics, followed by a crazy narcissistic ex who slammed a huge (size of small waste basket) 1/8” thick jar over my coconut, sending me bleeding all over the place, passing out (that was the SICKEST, worst feeling I had EVER...just as I was getting ready to pass out...never wanna experience that again), waking up to an ER doc stapling my head about 10 times without even a local anesthetic...fucking nightmare.  But I digress.

From my perspective, NFL needs to get off their asses and open up on head injuries and brain health of its players. Everyone loves a good, physically challenging football game. We just gotta do this thing smarter.
