I never said he was as good as Jackson. I meant that Kaepernick went 12-4 and won the NFC running a similar offense. Newton went 15-1 and won the NFC doing it. Kaepernick's playstyle wasnt stopped by film analysis, that playstyle is still effective, as recently as last year. Read-option, run a lot, throw it deep a lot. Jackson plays the same style, just better.
