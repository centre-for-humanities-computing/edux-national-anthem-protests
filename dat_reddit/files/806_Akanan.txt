I disagree with Kap protest on the field. Pro Football is a show, when you wear the uniform of an organisation and you run on the field SHOW ON.   
     
But i'm really uncomfortable with how NFL teams control everything off-field, medias, "forced volunteering", can do this, can't do that, etc...   
     
On the field, imo, not the right time. But im convinced teams wouldn't let him do his protest off-field anyway.
