There's another fact that people are missing. And btw i support kap 100%

Teams are very very afraid of losing their lockerooms. In that if the players dislike the coach/ownership it can be hell. 

Kap holds ALOT of sway and there is no doubt that he's the type of player that if something was to happen he could get his whole team to protest with him. 

It's just not worth the risk for an average QB, I can get a hundred yes men instead that don't come with the drama.
