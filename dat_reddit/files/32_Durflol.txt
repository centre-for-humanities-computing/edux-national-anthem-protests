Pointing out that the niners went 2-14 is disingenuous. Ownership scrapped the absolute shit out of that team and throwing out Harbaugh for Tomsula was a very clear sign to everyone that Niners management was hopeless. I genuinely cannot imagine who would have done well that last season, let alone led them to a winning record.
