Never argued against that. But looting your local businesses and homes hurt the police how? Oh wait, it doesn’t. 

Look at Baltimore post eric garner riots (&lt;10 yrs ago).Those areas are worse off than before, and this is what you consign law abiding citizens to when you want to wreck you community. Then your going to start whining why your community is destitute and you’ll only have yourself to blame. Worst part is, you will then leave and only screw over what community you would move to because you don’t think destroying your community is wrong.

Your tantrums only hurt your neighbor’s , work on meaningful change, cause Target doesn’t make laws. Better to be useless than be malignant.
