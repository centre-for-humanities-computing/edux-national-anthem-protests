No I’m not calling him that. I am saying he understands professionalism. Watch his interviews, he’s very careful about his answers. Very consistent answers, direct and short, not trying to stir controversy.

The way he portrays himself is very professional and he’s clearly been coached for it. Not saying he’s a saint, but he’s a great example of someone with talent who understands the importance of image for a business.
