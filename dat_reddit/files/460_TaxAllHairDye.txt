I remember seeing 2017 training camp "rankings" on the NFL Network where they had him in the low 20's to low 30's.  What that translates to is he would likely have to play in one of these scenarios:

* QB competition to start on a bad team
* Backup on a team where his play style fits (eg Ravens or Titans) 

Now the question to a team is: 

* How many net wins would Kaepernick yield vs another QB? 
* Do those extra wins mean a playoff spot? 
* Is the media circus worth it? 

I ask these questions because what is the point of signing Kaepernick, if he leads your team to 5 wins instead of 3 wins with a different QB.  The team gets a worse draft pick and a media circus. 

If a team signs him as a backup, he might never play and you get a media circus.  If he does play, your season might be sunk anyway as that means your top tier QB is hurt. 

Here's the thing, if Colin was a borderline starter as a Cornerback, I guarantee he would be signed. A borderline starter is guaranteed to play and have an impact. Additionally, there is a massive talent drop off at the position so someone who is 3rd or 4th best on a team is often many times more competent than the 5th or 6th best.
