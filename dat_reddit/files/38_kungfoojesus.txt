I support caps stance but this take is the most accurate. He was good, no doubt. Better than many, at worst a solid backup but not nearly elite or good enough to justify a perceived business side drawback.

It always seemed like a business decision to me. One that bowed to racist undertones for sure. The owners love their money. They may care about a cause but not nearly enough to cost them millions.
