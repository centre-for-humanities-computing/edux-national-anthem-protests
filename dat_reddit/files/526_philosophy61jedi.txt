Unfortunately, I hear that quite a bit. I played hockey from age 4 through college (no scholarship). I was extremely lucky to have had a family able and committed to allowing me to play as much as I did. With the cost of equipment, travel, ice time, league fees it can add up extremely quickly. For a Florida resident, I would suggest inline roller hockey. Much easier to find a place to play than on traditional ice.
