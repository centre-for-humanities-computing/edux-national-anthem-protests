Eric Reid was a big part of the protest and he consistently had a job and was signed before Tre Boston and Kenny Vacarro were. The more I think about that and Kaep being benched for Blaine Gabbert, the more I think Kaep wasn’t really a starting QB in the league. People throw out his 16 TD 4 INT year but totally ignore that he got benched for a laughing stock QB and was unable to win another job. The NFL also employs women beaters, kid beaters, murderers, rapists. 

Idk, as much as one would like to say he was black balled I’m not so sure anymore.
