Well, “I” am not an angry white man. I’m not over looking anything. This conversation is not political. It’s a conversation about the talent of professional football players. Keeping a starting QB job in the NFL is one of the most difficult things to do. TheCleveland Browns alone have had over 30 starting QBs since 2000. Hardly any of them were black. I’m simply stating that Colin Kaepernick skills were not good enough to land him a starting role in the NFL. “He” made the decision to not come back as a back up because he felt the role was beneath him. So take your political bullshit somewhere else and fuck off.
