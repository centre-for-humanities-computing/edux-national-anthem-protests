He didn't really come out of nowhere though. He had an excellent college career at Nevada and was a second rounder. And his style of game, read-option and lots of running, is still effective, look at Lamar Jackson. Once that lights-out SF defense tailed off and Harbaugh left, things went to shit. I'd say his decline as a player was due more to what I just mentioned, several injuries, and Chip fucking Kelly than it was to film analysis.
