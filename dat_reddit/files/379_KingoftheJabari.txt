I use to go to games with my dad every year, my wife and I would fly all over the county to go with games with him. He lives his team.

After the way the treat Kap, I could in good conscious spend that kind of money $500 plus for two tickets, then hotels, rental car, food and whatever else we did.

Fuck the NFL.

My dad still goes though.
