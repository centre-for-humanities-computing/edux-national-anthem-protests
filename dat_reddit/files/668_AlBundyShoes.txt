You’d have to retool your team and not many teams run that type of offense... citing the Ravens is silly.  They drafted a guy for that. 

Signing and unsigned free agent who hasn’t played in x years, yeah, I’d prefer not to build my offense around a mediocre at best qb who can only run one time of offense (or at least has only been in one system and lost the job)
