Not true, this is only true in a perfectly competitive market with infinite knowledge. It's entirely possible for every NFL team to be wrong about what would bring them more buisnesses. In fact, I bet if one team had chosen Kaepernick, they would have gotten more views and media attention because of it. It would very probably make up for the few fans who got so mad at the decision they stopped watching their team alltogether.
