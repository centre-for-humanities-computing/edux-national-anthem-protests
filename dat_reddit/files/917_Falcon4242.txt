I didn't say he literally couldn't, I said it's doubtful that he planned this stunt instead of having legitimate concerns about the event and falling to a backup plan. The only evidence you have of this being a premeditated PR stunt is a take from Stephen A...

The NFL contacts teams, says there will be an in-season workout for one player on a Saturday 5 days away. On Wednesday they sent Kaep the paperwork. Multiple media members have said that these things take time to read and the original copy had legitimate problems that could be used in court to argue that he waived his right to sue the League in the future for any reason. So Kaep sent back a different waiver, the NFL refused to sign it, and there we go. Much more mundane, huh? Not to mention Kaep requested the workout be open to media and have his own film crew present, which the NFL refused.

If the NFL planned this for longer and Kaep backed out late, then I can understand, as there would have been enough time for Kaep to raise these concerns early and get them worked out or bail early. But on such short notice you can only believe he did it for PR if you *completely ignore* his perspective and take listen to reactionary "media takes".
