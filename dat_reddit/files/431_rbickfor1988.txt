I mean, if you combine the words, yes. 

But as far as what the Constitutional right is, no. As in, your right to free speech is protected from the government. The government will not infringe upon that right. And even that has limits, as depending on what you’re saying, it can be considered dangerous enough not to be protected; hence, yelling “Fire!” in a crowded theater, causing a mass panic, and injuries as people rush to leave; this is not protected from the government. 

But the right to free speech is not protected from any other entity. If you decide to talk about how great Hitler is, you can be fired from Chipotle. If you go into a restaurant and start yelling about pedophiles being good people, they can refuse to serve you. Those are both reacting to the fact that they don’t have to listen to or not give consequences to your words.
