It's not really about being non-political in life. Richard Sherman has always been outspoken about social issues, and he doesn't have a problem getting signed. It's about being non-political when you're on the football field representing your team. Kaepernick was wearing pig socks and was hell bent on showing his displeasure with the national anthem and the flag. And then on top of all of that he was loud off the field too. And it all started happening suspiciously after his skill started to obviously decline. He was not good enough to put up with all the negative attention or run the risk of creating a rift in the locker rooms.

Edit: and if you think that late career Kaepernick had as much potential as Joe Burrow has now, then I'd be willing to wager that you really dont know football that well. To me, every side of the Kaepernick story is about business decisions. For the owners and for Kaepernick.
