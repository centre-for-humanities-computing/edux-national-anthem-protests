funny thing is I was wayyy better at hockey than football, my fam just couldn't afford the travel team expenses so I could get enough exposure to maybe get a hockey scholarship. high schools in florida dont have ice hockey teams unfortunately. I still have a really nice set of simmons pads, i need to strap them back up, its been forever.
