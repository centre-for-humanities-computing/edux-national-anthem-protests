He is partially right - plenty of other teams don’t want anything to do with him because of the political statements he took. And the league settled a lawsuit with him for collusion - which means it isn’t like there was no blame to be had on the part of the NFL. I think both things can be true. He had a couple of opportunities - but not as many as he should have had for a player of his caliber. 

There were at least two other players that were blackballed far worse than Kaep for there statements. Chris Kluwe of the Vikings (pro gay marriage statements) and Mahmoud Abdul Raouf of the Nuggets (Islamic opposition to the national anthem).  Both were in their primes and handed their walking papers never to play again. 

It goes to show, if you’re white, black, Christian, Islamic - doesn’t matter. If you’re a pro athlete making public statements about politics, sex, or race - you are probably going to get shown the door. It’s not right and it’s not fair. But it happens.
