If you look at his stats, he was not that good. According to many, he was pretty much busting out of the league the same exact moment he didn't get a contract

He also got an offer, but the GF basically destroyed that. He ALSO got an offer from the CFL, but that wasn't a good enough league for his highness

tl;dr: it's his own fault he is not playing
