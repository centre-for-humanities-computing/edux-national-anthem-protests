No, he wasn’t blackballed out of the league. Kaep was offered a contract with the Broncos the very next year.  
He turned it down because he though he was worth more than $11 million. Brock Osweiller also turned the Broncos same contract offer down so they ended up having to go with Trevor Siemien the year after their Super Bowl victory. 

Keep in mind that Kaep wanted $20 million, which would have made him the fifth highest paid QB in the league at that time. The Broncos offer of $11 million would have made him about the 20th highest paid - which would have been about right. Kaep just though he was worth more. Once he sat out a year, his value diminished.  Just like Antonio Brown’s value will diminish after sitting out last year.
