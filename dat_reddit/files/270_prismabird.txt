Yeah, but there was a series of events there. 

Kaepernick: takes a knee.

Trump: disrespectful! He should be fired! If fans boycott the games, they’ll fire him!

Trump followers: well, now I’m boycotting!

NFL: guess we better fire Kaepernick.

Let’s not pretend this happened in a vacuum. I saw this exact situation play out with my father, who suddenly couldn’t watch NFL because his president told him not to.
