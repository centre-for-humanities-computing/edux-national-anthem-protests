The fact is, viewership and fan loyalty probably wouldn’t be affected much either way. These teams sell out all their games and it would take more than hiring Kaepernick to make even the worst haters want to stop watching their teams play. Additionally, the teams share profits so even if they did lose some ticket and concession sales, they’d still make tons of money from merchandising and other revenues.

What it _is_ about is the ideal. It’s clear that the owners do not want to allow the nfl to be politicized in that way, either due to the message, or because they do not wish the NFL to be a forum for political expression. That is legitimate, and legal, even though I don’t agree with the owners. Many businesses have regulations they impose on employees for how they conduct themselves on the job and even in public (when not working). This ranges from dress codes and personal grooming standards to activity on social media and public speaking. In many states, where employment is “at will,” you can be fired for any reason (so long as it’s not illegal, like age, sex, race, religion). No employer is obliged to hire anyone, regardless of what they can bring to the table in terms of profitability, experience  or skill set.

If he wasn’t being hired due to his skin color, that would be illegal.
