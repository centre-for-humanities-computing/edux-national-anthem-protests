Oh I’m absolutely with him in what he (and the rest of the league) was protesting. But you have to be able to separate your football evaluations and your beliefs from outside of football. They can’t blur each other. People refuse to hear football related criticism of him because of their other beliefs surrounding him. 

Almost the entire league was kneeling. More people would’ve been blackballed if it was purely for the kneeling. Not the case. And I used Eric Reid as an example because he was big in the kneeling and he’s been a starter his entire career. And OP saying he’s a huge NFL fan but had no idea who Reid is is a total lie.
