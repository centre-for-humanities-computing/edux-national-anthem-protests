The NFL and the teams are just a business when it’s boiled down. Dumb people don’t own sports teams, and if they do they have smart people helping them run it. 

Even if the owner is in support of the cause he was trying to promote, they know their fan base most likely isn’t. Look at the general demographic of what you would call stereotypical diehard NFL fans. It’s obvious they mostly likely don’t support what Kaep was promoting. 

Business is about making money, and when you’re talking about millions upon millions of dollars of possibly lost revenue generally the greed of the rich team owners will outweigh their support of Kaep’s cause. 

Would an NBA time sign a player who made comments supporting the cop that killed George Floyd? No chance. 

And let me make the distinction that I know Kaep’s protest and supporting a cop that murdered someone are not the same, but that the thought process of the owners would be the same.
