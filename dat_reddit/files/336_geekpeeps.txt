Yes, I know there are plenty of excellent talent in lots of teams. I’m watching from Australia, btw, so we don’t see all the games. But I noticed that there are a lot, since Kapernick, where there is strong divide. It’s a game that I hope the most talented get to play, regardless of ethnicity. 

Stay safe over there
