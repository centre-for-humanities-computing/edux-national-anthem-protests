At some point we need stipulation from everyone that Kaepernick steadfastly refused to be anybody’s backup QB.  

His insistence about this and his refusal of genuine offers is not something that happened in an alternate universe’s timeline, but ours.  

This is precisely the meaning behind my question phrased “Doing what exactly?” thats being downvoted by his fans who maintain he was run out of football.
