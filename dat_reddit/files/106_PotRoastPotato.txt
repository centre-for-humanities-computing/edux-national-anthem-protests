He had a number of off-season surgeries before 2016 and as a result wasn't in playing shape at the start of the season. Once he was healthy he started again, and finished the season with a 90.7 QB rating (which is above average for an NFL starter), 16 TDs and 4 INTs on the worst team in the league. He actually played very well in 2016.
