My issue with Kaepernick was not that he was kneeling during the anthem, but that he was doing it at work. We view it all as a game and tend to forget that for them that is their place of work. Being on that field is their job as much as it is yours to sit at a desk or stand at a cash register. If any normal person were to take advantage of their job to push a politicized agenda, they would be fired. Employers do not take kindly to political division in the workplace. He had access to so much more money and time than average people that he could have found any number of platforms to successfully stand on and amplify his voice. Instead, he chose to use his employerâ€™s time and money and then essentially got excommunicated from the NFL.
