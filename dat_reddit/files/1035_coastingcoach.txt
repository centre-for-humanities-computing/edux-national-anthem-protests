Trying to think of this from a sport business perspective, an industry I work in. My initial reaction to this was... Surely signing him could only be good for business, being the one team thats willing to take stance and align themselves with a growing movement and therefore grow a new fanbase, shirt sales, ticket sales, more media coverage etc.

 I can only assume that either the team's sponsors, which should be a significant proportion of their income behind broadcasting (which shouldnt be impacted) would be against the move for whatever reason. Strange one, less so bad for business, more that the NFL team execs didn't want to grow some balls and take a stance (or didn't agree with the movement).
