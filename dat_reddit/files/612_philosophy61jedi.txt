I am. I have played and watched both. I’ve found this analogy works pretty well: football is a demolition derby where hockey is a stock car race. Every single play in football is violent where hockey is much more about finesse. 

Here’s a serious question: how can they be at the same level of violent contact when football plays 1 game per week that consists of 15-20 minutes of live play per game where hockey plays multiple games a week with 60 minutes of live play? It’s not even close. Football is **much** more violent than hockey.
