Ok letâ€™s not get carried away. That was not a poor SF team, they had the 2nd best defense in the league, a great TE and solid receivers, a Pro-Bowl RB, and they were just as successful with Alex Smith at QB. After that season and the subsequent one where they lost to the Seahawks his stats continually got worse and he got benched for freakin Blaine Gabbert in 2015. You are not better than half the starting QBs in the league if you get benched for Blaine Gabbert.
