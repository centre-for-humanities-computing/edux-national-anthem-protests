He might not have cared if it was bad for business, but the person who signed his paycheck DID care. The NFL wasnâ€™t his platform, the NFL was his EMPLOYER. In all likelihood, the NFL saw his point, but at the end of the day they canâ€™t have players using their league as a platform. The NFL just wants to play football and they want to make as much money as possible. The only color they really care about is green. 

And the country belongs to everyone. Get a grip. ðŸ™„
