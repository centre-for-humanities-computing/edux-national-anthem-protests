I was never talking about the law, i was talking about freedom of speech. They are not the same thing. One is an ideal or a value and the other is an attempt to uphold that value. 

If dominant Social media companies decided to delete every post of a particular political persuasion that would be an obstruction of freedom of speech. I dont care what the law is, the world would functionaly lose freedom of speech and that is something we should fight against. The ability to speak is what is important, not who may or may not be obstructing it.

What happened to Colin demonstrates that athletes in america are not free to speak their minds. Or in other words, they do not have freedom of speech.

Just to remind you, i never cared what the law was, that was never important, and still isnt. What is important is that people can raise their voice against injustice without some rich person shutting them down because it might affect their bottom line and somehow being respected more than someone fighting for social justice
