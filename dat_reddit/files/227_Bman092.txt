The original reason for the anthem protests was because of police violence. Athletes were staying seated during the anthem. An NFL played and Ex green barrette came out and was talking about how staying seated for the anthem was actually a bit disrespectful, that they should take a knee instead. 

And so the players took a knee (then raised fists later on) but it still got spun around and people said it was disrespecting the flag and the troops, it was never about that.
