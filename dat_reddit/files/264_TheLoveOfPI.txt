You don't get to protest at work. That's not what people fought and died for. Also, you're free to go call a nice grandmother walking down the street a ****. You're a piece of garbage for doing it, but you can. 

What you're putting forward is not really a valid analysis of the situation. Also, for plenty of people who didn't want the protests, they just want football to be apolitical from any political viewpoint.
