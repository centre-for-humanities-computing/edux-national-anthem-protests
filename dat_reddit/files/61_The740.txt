Drama bothers teams a great deal in general.  Tim Tebow never did anything wrong, and no team would ever sign him because he brings along a media circus and a very large, and frankly very obnoxious, group of people who are fans of his but don’t know the first thing about football.

Antonio Brown may be the best receiver in football, and he spent most of last year out of a job completely because he’s an annoying shitbird on his best day and drama follows him more than his own shadow does.
