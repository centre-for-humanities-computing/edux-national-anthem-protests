He wasn’t that great of a player to be anything other than a third string practice squad type of player. NFL teams keep around murders, dog killers, rapists , shit stirrers, whoever as long they’re good enough to contribute significantly toward winning to make headache of keeping on the team worth it. The juice was never worth the squeeze for him and his controversy quite frankly was almost completely irrelevant to him not being picked up by any team because best case scenario he would only be picked up by a team super desperate for a practice squad guy. Look at his Stats for the last season he had, he had the worst sack percentage of any quarterback in NFL history besides one other quarterback. He was a decent average NFL quarterback but, he was trending to be a backup in final season.
