It’s really despicable how college athletes can’t make money off of their likeness whilst the NCAA makes literal millions from certain players (such as #1 draft prospects) 

Makes me so happy how kids are realising this, the #1 basketball prospect out of high school this year is planning to go straight to the G league instead of college.
