Yes, lets take the word of a guy who was VP of league communications (not anything related to football or personnel) for less than two season and who earns his living carrying water for the Democrat party. This guy wasn't even part of the NFL when teams might have wanted Kaep.

This is the same NFL that signed Mike Vick and Donte Stallworth who both served jail time for killing dogs and people respectively. There's no such thing as bad for business, only people that are bad for football.
