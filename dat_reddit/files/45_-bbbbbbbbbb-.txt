The guy literally lost out to Blaine Gabbert in SF. People are delusional. He had 1 season of good play (surrounded by one of the best teams in football) and outside of that was terrible. He got worse in all aspects of the game every season after his good one.

People want this to be a race issue so desperately, but its just not. The NFL will sign anyone no matter how "bad for business" they might be if they can play. We're talking about the league that has dozens of domestic abusers on rosters. A league that signed Mike Vick after he literally went to prison for his brutal dog fighting operation. A league that had multiple teams sign Donte Stallworth after he literally killed someone driving drunk.

Half the country hates Trump and many of them are the younger audience that the NFL wants to reach. If Kaep could play or was willing to play for what he's worth he'd have been signed.
