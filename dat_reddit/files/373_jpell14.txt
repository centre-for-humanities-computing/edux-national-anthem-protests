Your job is no where near close to the NFL. Kind of a weird analogy. Sports is literally entertainment and these guys are broadcasted on tv where they become icons and heroes to many. They have a platform because we value their athletic ability. I guess Ali was wrong to protest on the job to you as well. Sports has been a way to move society forward- remember jackie robinson?

To suggest you protesting at a tech startup or a local healthcare office is anywhere near comparable just doesnt hold up.
