The NFL settled, which caused controversy and hurt their standing in some people's eyes. Fueled the opinion that there was fuckery going on. If Kaep had to prove the entire league was in on it, an virtually impossible task, then it would have made the league more likely to not settle, defend themselves in court, and claim the PR high ground ("see, we're legit, and this decision proved it"). Instead the requirement was lower, saw the PR risk if they lost, settled, and stayed quiet while being able to still deny the allegations.
