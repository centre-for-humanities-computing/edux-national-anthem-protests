Yeah, my bad, you're totally right. A temporary curfew in response to riots and dense crowds during a pandemic is totally the same thing as the Gestapo or NKVD (Soviet Secret Police).

The government does not have a policy of murdering unarmed civilians. It's explicitly against the law. The problem is not TOP DOWN, the problem is BOTTOM UP. There's a bunch of racist idiots out there.

Get real.
