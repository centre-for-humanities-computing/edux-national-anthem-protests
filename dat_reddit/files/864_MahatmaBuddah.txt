I was dying to play HS football. My mother said "no way Im signing the permission form, your brain is too important." Played soccer instead, but now, a few decades later, Ive said "thank you mom, for knowing what I didnt know when I was 13, many times, but especially about this.  (Iwas also a year yoer than anyone in my class bc I moved from a different state in 3rd grade!)
