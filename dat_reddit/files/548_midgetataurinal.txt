I said it's not that good. Good job changing my words, you're already starting off with lies lol. And he hardly threw picks because he held on to the ball getting sacked on nearly 10% of his drop backs. He never took chances, hence no picks but no wins either. Sam Bradford had that same ratio and won 7 games that season. So it must be racist owners as to why he's not starting anymore right?
