This is really my biggest deal. I don’t care about his decision to protest. He can do as he likes in regards to that for all I care. I just didn’t think he was a very good QB and for my back ups I prefer upside. I didn’t feel he had that anymore. Some may disagree, but that’s ok. That was just my thought.
