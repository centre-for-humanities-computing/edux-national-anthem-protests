While no one condones looting, on the other hand, one can understand the pent-up feelings that may result from decades of repression and people who have had members of their family killed by that regime, for them to be taking their feelings out on that regime. And I don't think there's anyone in any of those pictures â€¦ [who wouldn't] accept it as part of the price of getting from a repressed regime to freedom.
