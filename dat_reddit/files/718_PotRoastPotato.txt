What contracts did he turn down?

The only offer that didn't happen was that the a trade between the 49ers and Broncos fell through because the Broncos wanted the 49ers to pay part of his salary and the 49ers refused, and that wasn't really in Kaepernick's control.

Depending on the stats you use, he's an average starter or poor starter/excellent backup, so when you consider NFL teams all carry 3 QBs, he was more than talented enough to be on a roster.
