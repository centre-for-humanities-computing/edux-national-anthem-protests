I wasn’t referring to the curfew. I was referring to the arrest and attack of JOURNALISTS on live TV. Attacking journalists reporting the news is not something a free society does.

It’s explicitly against the law yet time and time again they don’t see jail time. The only reason these officers were even arrested is because it was on tape. We’ll see if he’s convicted and sentenced to any real jail time but if history is any indication then he won’t.

I’m not saying it’s a top down problem but there needs to be a top down solution and right now our leadership is failing that completely.
