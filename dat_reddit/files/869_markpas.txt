When I lived in South Dakota there was an infamous farmer who lived across the border in Nebraska and it seems the small town there had aspirations for glory but he refuse to let his healthy 250 pound sons play high school football. He said he had torn up his knee doing  it and he wasn't going to see any of his kids limping for the rest of their their lives the way he had too. Talk about social pressure. Apparently the consensus was that he was just being a selfish prick.
