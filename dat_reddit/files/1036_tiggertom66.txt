Again that's only if teams worked together to keep him out of the league.

Of all the teams that

1. Need a new QB.

2. Can afford Kaep.

And

3. Have play styles that would be compatible with Kaepernick.

Some may have looked at him and thought it simply wasn't worth the headache.

That isnt against the rules.

Its only against the rules if multiple teams communicate to keep him out. Or if the league tries to keep him out.
