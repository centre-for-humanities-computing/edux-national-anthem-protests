The fact that you are being downvoted further proves that Reddit is clueless as to how capitalism works. No one is forced to buy anything. You can eat before the game with a slight meal time adjustment, or pay for overpriced food. You aren’t a “captive” consumer if you purchase stadium food, you are unprepared and either willing to spend the money or not.

A good or service is worth as much as consumers are willing to pay for it. If everyone stopped buying $20 hotdogs, they wouldn’t be $20 for very long.
