Nah its cause he wasnt good enough for him to be worth the drama. Dude got benched for Blaine Gabbert, one of the worst QBs of this century. No doubt he wouldve been signed if he was still playing like he was in 2012, but at that point he was a shell of his former self.

Plus, Baltimore tried to sign him, but his gf called the Ravens owner a slave owner and their legendary middle linebacker a slave on social media. There are more factors here than just the kneeling.
