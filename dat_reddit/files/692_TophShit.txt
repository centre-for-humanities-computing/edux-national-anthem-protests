Okay mate, go get snowed over overpriced Dasani "water" and hotdogs then, if that's what you choose. I really couldn't care less. 

My only point was that you don't really have a choice when you go to these places. I never said it was right or wrong. 

I personally choose not to give them my money at all. Don't really see why you are so passionate about it, seems like a weird thing to get up in arms about.
