We definitely have a problem, my point is that calling us a police state is not helpful because it's not accurate. It gives people the wrong idea. "Police state" is a very powerful and freighted term and what we have is NOT that. We have a sick police apparatus due to many factors, but it's not a "control the population to stay in power" set of factors.

My belief is that it's the same as it ever was back to the inception of policemen themselves. It's just that citizens have mobile video recording and social media to post that video on broadly, so now there's visibility. In other words, the system has always been flawed, but now we finally have the tools to share just how badly those flaws hurt people.

&gt; I’m not saying it’s a top down problem but there needs to be a top down solution

How would you do that?
