You can be political all you want and stay in the NFL. Hell you can beat your wife and stay in the NFL. When you start impacting the bottom line and causing fans to boycott your team and the organization, you're gone. If a bunch of Bengals fans get vocal about Burrow, then he might be gone. That's what happened to Kaep. Because NFL teams are in the business of making money. And I know some loonies that till won't watch football (or claim not to) because of those protests.

I agree with his protest, 100%. I've carried caskets draped in that flag. I'll be buried draped in that flag. and never viewed it as disrespectful. But the NFL made the business choice. Because they're a business. And now Kaep's voice is stronger because of it.
