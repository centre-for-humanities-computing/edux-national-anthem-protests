Kaep was about to be signed to the Ravens, but then his girlfriend posted a picture on social media comparing the Ravens owner and Ray Lewis (Hall of Fame and Super Bowl winning linebacker for the Ravens) to Leo and Sam Jackson from Django. 

She essentially publicly called the Ravens owner and one of its most beloved players a slave owner and house slave. 

Shockingly, they didnâ€™t sign him after that.
