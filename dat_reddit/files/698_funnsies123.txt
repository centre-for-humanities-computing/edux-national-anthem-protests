NFL revenue is insane, just mind boggling levels of money, 25 billion dollars of revenue just last year alone. 

As heartless as it is, the money make the optics basically irrelevant. Insurances companies will just up the rates to counteract the bad publicity and the football players will pay because of how insane the money is. 

25 billion dollars a year will buy talent regardless of the risk. 

If gladiatorial death matches were legal and making 25 billion dollars, high school and middle schools would have gladiator training programs. 

Anyway the positive side of this is also because there is 25 billion dollars per year of revenue on the line, there are also tons of impetus for research, medical development, and equipment development. 

So there is real possibility of science finding ways to reverse, prevent, and treat all the horrible brain and body injuries associated with football which would lessen the risk and increase the longevity of the sport.
