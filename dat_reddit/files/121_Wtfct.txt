The kap situation had more to do with not wanting to deal with all the extra baggage of Kap for an average QB. Racism played a part yes but make no mistake that if Kap was Tom Brady good he would have still been playing. 

No one wants to bring all that drama onto their team for a backup QB which unfortunately is what Kap was projected to be.
