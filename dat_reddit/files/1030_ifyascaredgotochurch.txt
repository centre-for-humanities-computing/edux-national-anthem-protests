&gt;without bringing in controversy

Yup.. his issue was the controversy, not his play.

I just have an issue with the crowd who jumps in and acts like the controversy wasn't why he never go to play again and said he was trash anyway. He wasn't trash and was better than a lot of guys who got gigs the next year, including starters. He wasn't great at all, but to consistently be in the middle range means you're good enough to be a starter in the NFL, and he posted an almost top 15 passer rating in his final year in the league on a trash team.
