Oh please. Tell your president to stop tweeting because that isn't a substitute for governing.  Neither is golfing or watching TV.  But if thatâ€™s all he does when the nation is engulfed in crises (COVID-19, the economy, the murder of George Floyd), then he is not a president doing his job.

No one wants to see his bullshit, except for other self-loathing malcontents.
