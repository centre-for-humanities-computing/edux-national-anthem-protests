I wish I could find it but there’s a video on YouTube addressing the claim that Kaep wasn’t starting material, comparing his performance to other starting QBs. The conclusion was that his numbers were better than most starters, so it couldn’t have been his on the field performance that kept him out of the league.

Edit : I think this was it https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1I0cUTXwr-k
