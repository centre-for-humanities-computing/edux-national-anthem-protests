Those two situations are just not comparable in terms of PR. How many NFL fans had any idea about Hernandez’s gang activity prior to his murder arrest? Next to none. Of the public that doesn’t follow the NFL, likely zero. Because of that lack of public knowledge, it becomes a near non-factor for business purposes. 
  
Kaepernick’s protesting became a national story, and was heavily debated by people who don’t follow the NFL at all. Because of that public knowledge, the business challenges become much greater than signing another of many players with gang-related history of some kind.   
  
I thought some less delicate owner would give it a shot and just deal with the PR difficulties, or maybe even cynically try to get support from pro-Kaepernick people. In the end, it seems the juice wasn’t worth the squeeze for anyone.
