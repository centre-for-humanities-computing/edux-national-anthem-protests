If yours isn’t a rhetorical question, here’s an answer:

The timeline of those two apparent conflicting points you made were not concurrent, but end-joined. Your second point also needs adjusting unless you think *two* teams equals “a bunch”.  

It went like so: After being benched for poor play in favor of an even poorer player, Kaepernick received offers from Baltimore which his girlfriend apparently ruined with a hostile Tweet.  Then the Dolphins showed interest and Kaepernick ruined that himself with a Tweet supporting Fidel Castro which made him public enemy #1 with the Miami fan base.

And *that’s* when bench riding Kaepernick shoveled on the coal with his social justice efforts which evidently made any remaining interested franchises abandon any thought of acquiring a diminished gimmick QB with presently lousy stats and a media circus in tow under the condition he wouldn’t be a starter despite Kaepernick steadfastly refusing a backup position.
