Tbh, I don't really have too much anger towards the NFL. It's not their fault their fan base is racist. Nothing about the NFL messaging or players or messaging supports that, but it's still true.

Do I wish the NFL took an ethical position? Yes. But do we really expect billion dollar corporations to do that?
