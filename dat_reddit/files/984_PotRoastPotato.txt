&gt;You can reasonably conclude that he was blacklisted without having to make that absurd argument.

Good thing I never made that argument. The most I've said is that QB rating implies he was  just about an average  NFL starter, and his QB rating didn't take a sharp decline. 

That said his Super Bowl year he was way above average so I've never said he didn't decline in production, but he was also surrounded by the worst team in the league. I've also stipulated several times here that even if QBR or other less generous stats are the totally magically correct Word of God QB rating, Kaepernick still belongs on an NFL roster as a low-end starter or high-end backup.
