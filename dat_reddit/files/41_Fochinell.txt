Yes, I read it.  This former NFL VP of Communications is Joe Lockhart, former press secretary for President Clinton who was in the NFL’s front office for barely two seasons before he decided to “spend more time with his family” if you understand what that means.  Before that, he was at Facebook for a year heading their corporate policy team until he went unemployed for four years.

Probably before your time, but you might want to learn a little something about Joe Lockhart and his politically appointed favoritism no-show jobs in his post-Clinton era  (:Makes tipping bottle pantomime while issuing ‘glug glug glug’ sounds:)
