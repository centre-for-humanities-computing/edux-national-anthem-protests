&gt;The reason you can get a scholarship for gymnastics or volleyball or whatever is because of those two sports.

I don't believe this football and basketball making money is unique to the US. Volleyball scholarships are available at most universities or colleges with a competitive team. 

Even my local community College offers specifically volleyball scholarships and they aren't subsidized by the football team.

The idea that the revenue generated by football and basketball is necessary for college athletics is a spook in that it controls thinking and behavior despite being not being real

If money wasn't a problem in college sports in the US than why is in many states the highest paid salary that of a college football coach
