They had a great chance to go to the super bowl with Alex Smith as QB too... the 9ers were like 6-2 before Kap was even named starter... saying that team was only good because of him is revisionist as fuck. Smith was 6-2 and kap was 5-2. Both QBs played great that year but the team was amazing. 

He was praised extensively because he was flashing as fuck and entertaining to watch (not to mention had some incredible skill). But Running quarterbacks frequently follow his career path of 1-2 year of people trying to figure them out where they kick ass then they usually fall into mediocrity for a couple years and bounce out of the league.
