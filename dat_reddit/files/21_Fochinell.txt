&gt; The idea that Kaepernick wasn't good enough to be a backup or even third string QB somewhere by talent is pretty damn preposterous.

Kaepernick’s final season stats (a 2-14 season) placed him in the last third string position of 32 teams in the season the NFL consented to give him a public workout in his lawsuit settlement.  They’ve talked the subject to death with supporting stats on /r/NFL.

Kaepernick apparently wasn’t going to accept anything but a starting QB position at his tremendous salary rate while showing performance about equal to the Cleveland Brown’s third string QB backup.

The man had four solid seasons and went to crap.  It happens to NFL Quarterbacks.
