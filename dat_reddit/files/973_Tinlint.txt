well alrighty then, not sure who this ex nfl rep is, decent bet this guy was fired for not understanding the company he works for. clearly doesn't understand the vikings NFL team or the chance of a 4 year removed player to make it back in the NFL. point blank the vikings are about the team, not an individual, later diggs!

his fucking playertribune article started nearly every sentence with 'i' 

the people having fun are not the ones complaining about others. this guy kaep if he wanted to actually play football an shown his talent was still there, maybe he just liked to play football, he would have played with the xfl or aafl? maybe? 

&amp;#x200B;

zero fun sir
