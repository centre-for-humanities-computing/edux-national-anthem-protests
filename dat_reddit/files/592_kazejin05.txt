I've slowly stopped watching sports in general these past few years, but the NFL is completely off my radar these days for multiple reasons. The way they treated Colin Kaepernick is high on the list. The way they covered up the effects of CTE for years, and even now refuse to pay players from the 70s and 80s with health problems directly related to the sport. It just doesn't appeal to me anymore, and I don't miss it at all.
