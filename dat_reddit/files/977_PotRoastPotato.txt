I never said he wasn't benched for a couple of games, he was. You're being dishonest because the only reason it would matter is if Gabbert actually played better than Kaepernick, which he didn't, he played **much** worse.

Stop being dishonest and misrepresenting what happened and acting like Blaine Gabbert was ever a better QB than him.

(If you're not being dishonest, if you're not insinuating that Gabbert was better then there's literally no point to your argument. The only reason to bring it up is to pretend Gabbert was better than Kaepernick. He was not. It was a 2-14 team benching their QB through no fault of his own because that's what poorly-run 2-14 teams do.)
