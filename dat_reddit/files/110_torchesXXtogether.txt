I’m not entirely sure this is relevant, but here we go. 

About 1.5-2 years ago I was in a mental hospital run by the VA. I was, at the time, the only person I’m the ward. Then another guy came in. We tried to talk and get to know each other. But he made sure to let me know that he hated the NFL and only watched college football, because of the protests. And I just thought “as much as I don’t identify myself as a vet (I mean technically I am, but it’s not a part of my identity.) didnt we swear to defend the constitution and that includes free speech?”

I’ve never understood the idea that the same people who are for “small government” or are “sovereign citizens” would hate someone protesting this way. 

Yeah. I don’t get it.
