A team can flat out say "we don't want this guy because he is a distraction''. It literally happens all the time. Each team can individually come to that conclusion. That is 'legal'.

It would be 'illegal' if all the teams were talking and came to that agreement/conclusion.

The outcome is the same but the road to get there is extremely different. That difference is the make or break part of whether or not it is legal/illegal.
