During Kaep's four years, he finished on average at the 19th spot in passer rating, which puts him right there with middle of the pack QBs. Tim Tebow was hot trash. Tebow's best year saw him on a playoff Broncos team that was blown out by every team with a winning record. Kaep put up better numbers than Tim on his worst team which was a  terrible 49ers team that had already fallen apart. They both started 11 games in those seasons and Kaep put up more passing yards, more touchdowns, less interceptions, higher passer rating, higher QBR, etc. 

Kaep's "decline" coincided with the team falling apart with retirements (Willis), injuries (Bowman, etc), roster moves, and the kneeling "controversey".

Was he elite? No. Was he good enough to be on a roster. Absolutely.
