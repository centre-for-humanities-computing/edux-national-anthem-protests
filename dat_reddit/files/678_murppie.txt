But the real problem is that even the people who support what Kaepernick was doing and knew that the NFL owners were full of shit as to why he wasn't getting signed still tune in to the NFL games.  Even after all of the protesting that is happening right now I am more than willing to bet that viewing of NFL games is equal to what it was last season.
